<h1 title="">TWO LITTLE PILGRIMS&rsquo; PROGRESS</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">I</span></h2>
<p>The sun had set, and the shadows were deepening
in the big barn. The last red glow&mdash;the
very last bit which reached the corner the children
called the Straw Parlor&mdash;had died away,
and Meg drew her knees up higher, so as to bring
the pages of her book nearer to her eyes as the
twilight deepened, and it became harder to read.
It was her bitterest grievance that this was what
always happened when she became most interested
and excited&mdash;the light began to fade away,
and the shadows to fill all the corners and close
in about her.</p>
<p>She frowned as it happened now&mdash;a fierce little
frown which knitted her childish black brows as
she pored over her book, devouring the page,
with the determination to seize on as much as
was possible. It was like running a desperate
race with the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>She was a determined child, and no one would
have failed to guess as much who could have
watched her for a few moments as she sat on her
curious perch, her cheeks supported by her hands,
her shock of straight black hair tumbling over
her forehead.</p>
<p>The Straw Parlor was the top of a straw stack
in Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s barn. Robin had discovered it
one day by climbing a ladder which had been left
leaning against the stack, and when he had found
himself on the top of it he had been enchanted by
the feeling it gave him of being so high above the
world, and had called Meg up to share it with him.</p>
<p>She had been even more enchanted than he.</p>
<p>They both hated the world down below&mdash;Aunt
Matilda&rsquo;s world&mdash;which seemed hideous and exasperating
and sordid to them in its contrast to
the world they had lived in before their father
and mother had died, and they had been sent to
their sole relation, who did not want them, and
only took them in from respect to public opinion.
Three years they had been with Aunt Matilda,
and each week had seemed more unpleasant than
the last. Mrs. Matilda Jennings was a renowned
female farmer of Illinois, and she was far too energetic
a manager and business woman to have time
to spend on children. She had an enormous farm,
and managed it herself with a success and ability
which made her celebrated in agricultural papers.
If she had not given her dead brother&rsquo;s children a
home, they would have starved or been sent to
the poorhouse. Accordingly, she gave them food
to eat and beds to sleep in, but she scarcely ever
had time to notice them. If she had had time to
talk to them, she had nothing to say. She cared
for nothing but crops and new threshing-machines
and fertilizers, and they knew nothing about such
things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;She never says anything but &lsquo;Go to bed,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Keep out of the way.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s not like a woman
at all,&rdquo; Meg commented once, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s like a man
in woman&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their father had been rather like a woman in
man&rsquo;s clothes. He was a gentle, little, slender
man, with a large head. He had always been
poor, and Mrs. Matilda Jennings had regarded
him as a contemptible failure. He had had no
faculty for business or farming. He had taught
school, and married a school teacher. They had
had a small house, but somehow it had been as
cosey as it was tiny. They had managed to surround
themselves with an atmosphere of books,
by buying the cheap ones they could afford and
borrowing the expensive ones from friends and
circulating libraries. The twins&mdash;Meg and Robin&mdash;had
heard stories and read books all the first
years of their lives, as they sat in their little seats
by the small, warm fireside. In Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s
bare, cold house there was not a book to be seen.
A few agricultural papers were scattered about.
Meals were hurried over as necessary evils. The
few people who appeared on the scene were
farmers, who talked about agricultural implements
and the wheat market.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a bare place,&rdquo; Robin used to say, and
he would drive his hands into the depths of his
pockets and set his square little jaw, and stare before
him.</p>
<p>Both the twins had that square little jaw.
Neither of them looked like their father and
mother, except that from their mother they inherited
black hair. Robin&rsquo;s eyes were black, but
Meg&rsquo;s were gray, with thick black lashes. They
were handsome little creatures, but their shocks
of straight black hair, their straight black brows
and square little jaws, made them look curiously
unlike other children. They both remembered
one winter evening, when, as they sat on their
seat by the fire, their father, after looking at them
with a half smile for a moment or so, began to
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said to their mother, &ldquo;do you
know who those two are like? You have heard
me speak of Matilda often enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;surely they are
not like Matilda?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it is too much to say they are
like her,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but there is something
in their faces that reminds me of her strongly. I
don&rsquo;t know what it is exactly, but it is there. It
is a good thing, perhaps,&rdquo; with a queer tone in
his voice. &ldquo;Matilda always did what she made
up her mind to do. Matilda was a success. I
was always a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, Bob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not a failure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had put her hand on his shoulder, and he
lifted it and pressed it against his thin cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I, Maggie?&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t
I? Well, I think these two will be like Matilda in
making up their minds and getting what they
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the winter was over Robin and Meg
were orphans, and were with Aunt Matilda, and
there they had been ever since.</p>
<p>Until the day they found the Straw Parlor it had
seemed as if no corner in the earth belonged to
them. Meg slept on a cot in a woman servant&rsquo;s
room, Robin shared a room with some one else.
Nobody took any notice of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any one meets us anywhere,&rdquo; Meg said,
&ldquo;they always look surprised. Dogs who are not
allowed in the house are like us. The only difference
is that they don&rsquo;t drive us out. But we are
just as much in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Robin; &ldquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t for you,
Meg, I should run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere,&rdquo; said Robin, setting his jaw; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
find a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for you,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;I should be
so lonely that I should walk into the river. I
wouldn&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo; It is worth noticing that she
did not say &ldquo;I <i>could</i> not stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after the day they found the Straw Parlor
they had an abiding-place. It was Meg who pre&euml;mpted
it before she had been on the top of the
stack five minutes. After she had stumbled
around, looking about her, she stopped short,
and looked down into the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is another world. We
are miles and miles away from Aunt Matilda.
Let us make this into our home&mdash;just yours and
mine&mdash;and live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in nobody&rsquo;s way&mdash;nobody will even
know where we are,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;Nobody ever
asks, you know. Meg, it will be just like our
own. We will live here.&rdquo; And so they did. On
fine days, when they were tired of playing, they
climbed the ladder to rest on the heap of yellow
straw; on wet days they lay and told each other
stories, or built caves, or read their old favorite
books over again. The stack was a very high
one, and the roof seemed like a sort of big tent
above their heads, and the barn floor a wonderful,
exaggeratedly long, distance below. The birds
who had nests in the rafters became accustomed
to them, and one of the children&rsquo;s chief entertainments
was to lie and watch the mothers and
fathers carry on their domestic arrangements,
feeding their young ones, and quarrelling a little
sometimes about the way to bring them up. The
twins invented a weird little cry, with which they
called each other, if one was in the Straw Parlor
and the other one entered the barn, to find out
whether it was occupied or not. They never
mounted to the Straw Parlor, or descended from
it, if any one was within sight. This was their
secret. They wanted to feel that it was very
high, and far away from Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world,
and if any one had known where they were,
or had spoken to them from below, the charm
would have been broken.</p>
<p>This afternoon, as Meg pored over her book,
she was waiting for Robin. He had been away
all day. At twelve years old Robin was not of a
light mind. When he had been only six years
old he had had serious plans. He had decided
that he would be a great inventor. He had also
decided&mdash;a little later&mdash;that he would not be poor,
like his father, but would be very rich. He had
begun by having a savings bank, into which he
put rigorously every penny that was given to him.
He had been so quaintly systematic about it that
people were amused, and gave him pennies instead
of candy and toys. He kept a little banking
book of his own. If he had been stingy he would
have been a very unpleasant little boy, but he
was only strict with himself. He was capable of
taking from his capital to do the gentlemanly
thing by Meg at Christmas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has the spirit of the financier, that is all,&rdquo;
said his father.</p>
<p>Since he had been with Aunt Matilda he had
found opportunities to earn a trifle rather frequently.
On the big place there were small,
troublesome duties the farm hands found he could
be relied on to do, which they were willing to
pay for. They found out that he never failed
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart little chap,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;always up to
time when he undertakes a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-day he had been steadily at work under the
head man. Aunt Matilda had no objection to his
odd jobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has his living to earn, and he may as well
begin,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>So Meg had been alone since morning. She
had only one duty to perform, and then she was
free. The first spring they had been with Aunt
Matilda Robin had invested in a few chickens,
and their rigorous care of them had resulted in
such success that the chickens had become a sort
of centre of existence to them. They could always
have any dreams of the future upon the fortune
to be gained by chickens. You could calculate
on bits of paper about chickens and eggs
until your head whirled at the magnitude of your
prospects. Meg&rsquo;s duty was to feed them, and
show them scrupulous attentions when Robin
was away.</p>
<p>After she had attended to them she went to the
barn, and, finding it empty, climbed up to the
Straw Parlor with an old &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; to
spend the day.</p>
<p class="tb">This afternoon, when the light began to redden
and then to die away, she and Christian were very
near the gates. She longed so to go in with him,
and was yearning towards them with breathless
eagerness, when she heard Robin&rsquo;s cry below,
coming up from the barn floor.</p>
<p>She sprang up with a start, feeling bewildered
a second, before she answered. The City Beautiful
was such millions&mdash;such millions of miles away
from Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s barn. She found herself
breathing quickly and rubbing her eyes, as she
heard Robin hurrying up the ladder.</p>
<p>Somehow she felt as if he was rather in a hurry,
and when his small, black shock head and wide-awake
black eyes appeared above the straw she
had a vague feeling that he was excited, and that
he had come from another world. He clambered
on to the stack and made his way to her, and
threw himself full length on the straw at her
side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meg!&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;Hallo, you look as if you
were in a dream! Wake up!&mdash;Jones and Jerry
are coming to the barn&mdash;I hurried to get here
before them; they&rsquo;re talking about something I
want you to hear&mdash;something new! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robin!&rdquo; said Meg, clutching her book
and coming back to earth with a sigh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to hear Jones and Jerry. I don&rsquo;t want to
hear any of the people down there. I&rsquo;ve been
reading the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; and I do wish&mdash;I
do so <i>wish</i> there <i>was</i> a City Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin gave a queer little laugh. He really was
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is going to be one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Jones
and Jerry don&rsquo;t really know it, but it is something
like that they are talking about; a City Beautiful&mdash;a
real one&mdash;on this earth, and not a hundred
miles away. Let&rsquo;s get near the edge and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">II</span></h2>
<p>They drew as near to the edge as they could
without being seen. They did not understand in
the least. Robin was not given to practical jokes,
but what he had said sounded rather as if there
was a joke somewhere. But she saw Jones and
Jerry enter the barn, and saw, before they entered,
that they were deep in talk. It was Jones who
was speaking. Jones was Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s head
man, and was an authority on many things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been exhibitions and fairs all over the
world,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s been nothing
like what this will be. It will be a city, that&rsquo;s
what it will be, and all the world is going to be
in it. They are going to build it fronting on the
water, and bank the water up into lakes and canals,
and build places like white palaces beside
them, and decorate the grounds with statues and
palms and flowers and fountains, and there&rsquo;s not a
country on earth that won&rsquo;t send things to fill the
buildings. And there won&rsquo;t be anything a man
can&rsquo;t see by going through &rsquo;em. It&rsquo;ll be as good
as a college course to spend a week there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg drew a little closer to Robin in the straw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are they talking about?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>Jerry, who was moving about at some work
below, gave a chuckling laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust &rsquo;em to do the biggest thing yet, or bust,
them Chicago people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be
the biggest thing&mdash;a Chicago Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not goin&rsquo; to be the Chicago Fair,&rdquo; Jones
said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to put up with no such
idea as that; it&rsquo;s the World&rsquo;s Fair. They&rsquo;re going
to ring in the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Chicago out an&rsquo; out,&rdquo; said Jerry.
&ldquo;Buildin&rsquo;s twenty stories high, an&rsquo; the thermometer
twenty-five degrees below zero, an&rsquo; a World&rsquo;s
Fair. Christopher Columbus! I&rsquo;d like to see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet Christopher Columbus would like to see
it,&rdquo; said Jones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of compliment to him
they&rsquo;re getting it up&mdash;for discovering Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know he made his name that
way partic&rsquo;lar,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Thought what he
prided hisself on was discoverin&rsquo; America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing,&rdquo; said Jones, &ldquo;same thing! Wouldn&rsquo;t
have had much to blow about, and have statues
set up, and comic operas written about him, if it
had only been America he&rsquo;d discovered. Chicago
does him full credit, and she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give him a
send-off that&rsquo;ll be a credit to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Robin smothered a little laugh in his coat-sleeve.
He was quite used to hearing jokes about Chicago.
The people in the country round it were enormously
proud of it, and its great schemes and
great buildings and multi-millionaires, but those
who were given to jokes had the habit of being
jocular about it, just as they had the habit of proclaiming
and dwelling upon its rush and wealth
and enterprise. But Meg was not a jocular person.
She was too intense and easily excited. She
gave Robin an impatient nudge with her elbow,
not in reproof, but as a sort of irrepressible ejaculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t be funny,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I want them to tell more about it. I wish they&rsquo;d
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they did not go on; at least, not in any way
that was satisfactory. They only remained in the
barn a short time longer, and they were busy with
the work they had come to do. Meg craned her
neck and listened, but they did not tell more, and
she was glad when they went away, so that she
could turn to Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know more than that?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Is it true? What have you heard? Tell me
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot to-day,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;They
were all talking about it all the time, and I meant
to tell you myself, only I saw Jones and Jerry
coming, and thought, perhaps, we should hear
something more if we listened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>They clambered over to their corner and made
themselves comfortable. Robin lay on his back,
but Meg leaned on her elbows, as usual, with
her cheeks resting on her hands. Her black elf-locks
hung over her forehead, and her big eyes
shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;go on. What&rsquo;s the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would take a week
to tell it all, I should think. But it&rsquo;s going to be
the most wonderful thing in the world. They are
going to build a place that will be like a white,
beautiful city, on the borders of the lake&mdash;that
was why I called it the City Beautiful. It won&rsquo;t
be on the top of a hill, of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it is on the edge of the lake, and the sun
shines and the big water is blue and there are
shining white palaces, it will be better, I believe,&rdquo;
said Meg. &ldquo;What is going to be in the city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in the world,&rdquo; said Robin.
&ldquo;Things from everywhere&mdash;from every country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a great many countries,&rdquo; said Meg.
&ldquo;You know how it is in the geography. Europe,
Asia, and Africa, as well as America. Spain and
Portugal and France and England&mdash;and Sweden
and Norway and Russia and Lapland&mdash;and India&mdash;and
Italy&mdash;and Switzerland, and all the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be things&mdash;and people&mdash;brought
from them all. I heard them say so. They say
there will be villages, with people walking about
in them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/img003.jpg" alt="&ldquo;EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD,&rdquo; SAID ROBIN." width="600" height="774" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD,&rdquo; SAID ROBIN.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do they walk about when they are at home?&rdquo;
exclaimed Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the queer clothes they wear in their
own countries. There&rsquo;s going to be an Esquimaux
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With dogs and sledges?&rdquo; cried Meg, lifting
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and you know that place in Italy where
the streets are made of water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Venice,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;And they go about
in boats called gondolas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the men who take them about are called
gondoliers,&rdquo; interrupted Robin. &ldquo;And they have
scarfs and red caps, and push their boats along
with poles. There will be gondolas at the Fair,
and people can get into them and go about the
canals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as they do in Venice?&rdquo; Meg gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as they do in Venice. And it will be the
same with all the other countries. It will be as if
they were all brought there&mdash;Spanish places and
Egyptian places and German places&mdash;and French
and Italian and Irish and Scotch and English&mdash;and
all the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go there would be like travelling all over
the world,&rdquo; cried Meg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rob, excitedly. &ldquo;And all the
trades will be there, and all the machines&mdash;and
inventions&mdash;and pictures&mdash;and books&mdash;and statues&mdash;and
scientific things&mdash;and wonderful things&mdash;and
everything any one wants to learn about in
all the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his excitement, his words had become so rapid
that they almost tumbled over each other, and
he said the last sentence in a rush. There were
red spots on his cheeks, and a queer look in his
black eyes. He had been listening to descriptions
of this thing all day. A new hand, hot from the
excitement in Chicago, had been among the
workers. Apparently he had heard of nothing
else, thought of nothing else, talked of nothing
else, and dreamed of nothing else but the World&rsquo;s
Fair for weeks. Finding himself among people
who had only bucolic and vague ideas about it,
he had poured forth all he knew, and being a
rather good talker, had aroused great excitement.
Robin had listened with eyes and ears wide open.
He was a young human being, born so full of energy
and enterprise that the dull, prosaic emptiness
of his life in Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world had been
more horrible than he had been old enough to
realize. He could not have explained why it had
seemed so maddening to him, but the truth was
that in his small, boyish body was imprisoned the
force and ability which in manhood build great
schemes, and not only build, but carry them out.
In him was imprisoned one of the great business
men, inventors, or political powers of the new
century. But of this he knew nothing, and so ate
his young heart out in Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world,
sought refuge with Meg in the Straw Parlor, and
was bitterly miserable and at a loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>How he had drunk in every word the man from
Chicago had uttered! How he had edged near
to him and tried not to lose him for a moment!
How he had longed for Meg to listen with him,
and had hoarded up every sentence! If he had
not been a man in embryo, and a strong and clear-headed
creature, he would have done his work
badly. But he never did his work badly. He
held on like a little bulldog, and thought of what
Meg would say when they sat in the straw together.
Small wonder that he looked excited
when his black head appeared above the edge of
the straw. He was wrought up to the highest
pitch. Small wonder that there were deep red
spots on his cheeks, and that there was a queer,
intense look in his eyes, and about his obstinate
little mouth.</p>
<p>He threw up his arms with a desperate gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Everything</i>,&rdquo; he said again, staring straight
before him, &ldquo;that any one could want to learn
about&mdash;everything in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robin!&rdquo; said Meg, in quite a fierce little
voice, &ldquo;and we&mdash;<i>we</i> shall never see it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>She saw Robin clinch his hands, though he said
nothing, and it made her clinch her own hands.
Robin&rsquo;s were tough, little, square-fingered fists,
brown and muscular; Meg&rsquo;s hands were long-fingered,
flexible, and slender, but they made good
little fists when they doubled themselves up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we never see anything! We
never hear anything! We never learn anything!
If something doesn&rsquo;t happen we shall be Nothings&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what we shall be&mdash;Nothings!&rdquo; And she
struck her fist upon the straw.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s jaw began to look very square, but he
did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are twelve years old,&rdquo; Meg went on.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here three years, and we don&rsquo;t know
one thing we didn&rsquo;t know when we came here.
If we had been with father and mother we should
have been learning things all the time. We
haven&rsquo;t one thing of our own, Rob, but the
chickens and the Straw Parlor&mdash;and the Straw
Parlor might be taken away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s square jaw relaxed just sufficiently to
allow of a grim little grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the Treasure, Meg,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s laugh had rather a hysterical sound.
That she should not have mentioned the Treasure
among their belongings was queer. They
talked so much about the Treasure. At this
moment it was buried in an iron bank, deep in
the straw, about four feet from where they sat.
It was the very bank Robin had hoarded his savings
in when he had begun at six years old with
pennies, and a ten-cent blank-book to keep his
accounts in. Everything they had owned since
then had been pushed and dropped into it&mdash;all
the chicken and egg money, and all Robin had
earned by doing odd jobs for any one who would
give him one. Nobody knew about the old iron
bank any more than they knew about the Straw
Parlor, and the children, having buried it in the
straw, called it the Treasure. Meg&rsquo;s stories about
it were numerous and wonderful. Sometimes
magicians came, and multiplied it a hundred-fold.
Sometimes robbers stole it, and they themselves
gave chase, and sought it with wild adventure;
but perhaps the most satisfactory thing was to
invent ways to spend it when it had grown to
enormous proportions. Sometimes they bought
a house in New York, and lived there together.
Sometimes they traded in foreign lands with it.
Sometimes they bought land, which increased in
value to such an extent that they were millionaires
in a month. Ah! it was a treasure indeed.</p>
<p>After the little, low, over-strained laugh, Meg
folded her arms on the straw and hid her face in
them. Robin looked at her with a troubled air
for about a minute. Then he spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use doing that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use doing anything,&rdquo; Meg answered,
her voice muffled in her arms. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
do this any more than you do. We&rsquo;re so lonely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re lonely,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
And he stared up at the dark rafters above him,
and at some birds who were clinging to them and
twittering about a nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I wished there was a City Beautiful,&rdquo;
Meg said, &ldquo;but it seems to make it worse that
there is going to be something like it so near,
and that we should never get any nearer to it
than a hundred miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob sat up, and locked his hands together
round his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; cried Meg, desperately, and
she lifted her head, turning her wet face sideways
to look at him. He unlocked his hands to give
his forehead a hard rub, as if he were trying either
to rub some thought out of or into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because we are lonely there <i>is</i> use in
doing things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody to do
them for us. At any rate, we&rsquo;ve got as far on the
way to the City as the bottom of the Hill of Difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he gave his forehead another rub and
looked straight before him, and Meg drew a little
closer to him on the straw, and the family of birds
filled the silence with domestic twitters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">III</span></h2>
<p>During the weeks that followed they spent
more time than ever in their hiding-place. They
had an absorbing topic of conversation, a new
and wonderful thing, better than their old books,
even better than the stories Meg made when she
lay on the straw, her elbows supporting her, her
cheeks on her hands, and her black-lashed gray
eyes staring into space. Hers were always good
stories, full of palaces and knights and robber
chiefs and fairies. But this new thing had the
thrill of being a fairy story which was real&mdash;so
real that one could read about it in the newspapers,
and everybody was talking about it, even
Aunt Matilda, her neighbors, and the work-hands
on the farm. To the two lonely children, in their
high nest in the straw-stack, it seemed a curious
thing to hear these people in the world below
talk about it in their ordinary, everyday way,
without excitement or awe, as if it was a new
kind of big ploughing or winnowing machine.
To them it was a thing so beautiful that they
could scarcely find the words to express their
thoughts and dreams about it, and yet they
were never alone together without trying to
do so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>On wet, cheerless days, in which they huddled
close together in their nest to keep from being
chilled, it was their comfort to try to imagine
and paint pictures of the various wonders until,
in their interest, they forgot the dampness of the
air, and felt the unending patter of the rain-drops
on the barn roof merely a pleasant sort of accompaniment
to the stories of their fancies.</p>
<p>Since the day when they had listened to Jones
and Jerry joking, down below them in the barn,
Rob had formed the habit of collecting every
scrap of newspaper relating to the wonder. He
cut paragraphs out of Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s cast-aside
newspapers; he begged them from the farm-hands
and from the country store-keepers. Anything in
the form of an illustration he held as a treasure
beyond price, and hoarded it to bring to Meg
with exultant joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>How they pored over these things, reading the
paragraphs again and again, until they knew them
almost by heart. How they studied the pictures,
trying to gather the proportions and color of every
column and dome and arch! What enthusiast,
living in Chicago itself, knew the marvel as
they did, and so dwelt on and revelled in its
beauties! No one knew of their pleasure; like
the Straw Parlor, it was their secret. The strangeness
of their lives lay in the fact that absolutely
no one knew anything about them at all, or asked
anything, thinking it quite sufficient that their
friendlessness was supplied with enough animal
heat and nourishment to keep their bodies alive.</p>
<p>Of that other part of them&mdash;their restless,
growing young brains and naturally craving
hearts, which in their own poor enough but still
human little home had at least been recognized
and cared for&mdash;Aunt Matilda knew nothing, and,
indeed, had never given a thought to it. She
had not undertaken the care of intelligences and
affections; her own were not of an order to require
supervision. She was too much occupied
with her thousand-acre farm, and the amazing
things she was doing with it. That the children
could read and write and understood some arithmetic
she knew. She had learned no more herself,
and had found it enough to build her fortune
upon. She had never known what it was to feel
lonely and neglected, because she was a person
quite free from affections and quite enough for
herself. She never suspected that others could
suffer from a weakness of which she knew nothing,
because it had never touched her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>If any one had told her that these two children,
who ate her plentiful, rough meals at her table,
among field-hands and servants, were neglected
and lonely, and that their dim knowledge of it
burned in their childish minds, she would have
thought the announcement a piece of idle, sentimental
folly; but that no solid detail of her farming
was a fact more real than this one was the
grievous truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were at home,&rdquo; was Meg&rsquo;s summing-up
of the situation, &ldquo;at least we belonged
to somebody. We were poor, and wore our
clothes a long time, and had shabby shoes, and
couldn&rsquo;t go on excursions, but we had our little
bench by the fire, and father and mother used to
talk to us and let us read their books and papers,
and try to teach us things. I don&rsquo;t know what
we were going to be when we grew up, but we
were going to do some sort of work, and know as
much as father and mother did. I don&rsquo;t know
whether that was a great deal or not, but it was
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was enough to teach school,&rdquo; said Robin.
&ldquo;If we were not so far out in the country now, I
believe Aunt Matilda would let us go to school
if we asked her. It wouldn&rsquo;t cost her anything
if we went to the public school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t if we didn&rsquo;t ask her,&rdquo; said Meg.
&ldquo;She would never think of it herself. Do you
know what I was thinking yesterday? I was
looking at the pigs in their sty. Some of them
were eating, and one was full, and was lying
down going to sleep. And I said to myself,
&lsquo;Robin and I are just like you. We live just
like you. We eat our food and go to bed, and
get up again and eat some more food. We don&rsquo;t
learn anything more than you do, and we are not
worth as much to anybody. We are not even
worth killing at Christmas.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they had never known any other life, or if
nature had not given them the big, questioning
eyes and square little jaws and strong, nervous
little fists, they might have been content to sink
into careless idleness and apathy. No one was
actively unkind to them; they had their Straw
Parlor, and were free to amuse themselves as
they chose. But they had been made of the material
of which the world&rsquo;s workers are built, and
their young hearts were full of a restlessness and
longing whose full significance they themselves
did not comprehend.</p>
<p>And this wonder working in the world beyond
them&mdash;this huge, beautiful marvel, planned by
the human brain and carried out by mere human
hands; this great thing with which all the world
seemed to them to be throbbing, and which
seemed to set no limit to itself and prove that
there was no limit to the power of human wills
and minds&mdash;this filled them with a passion of
restlessness and yearning greater than they had
ever known before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is an enchanted thing, you know, Robin&mdash;it&rsquo;s
an enchanted thing,&rdquo; Meg said one day, looking
up from her study of some newspaper clippings
and a magazine with some pictures in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like it,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s enchanted,&rdquo; Meg went on. &ldquo;It
seems so tremendous that people should think
they could do such huge things. As if they felt
as if they could do anything or bring anything
from anywhere in the world. It almost frightens
me sometimes, because it reminds me of the
Tower of Babel. Don&rsquo;t you remember how the
people got so proud that they thought they could
do anything, and they began to build the tower
that was to reach to heaven; and then they all
woke up one morning and found they were all
speaking different languages and could not understand
each other. Suppose everybody was
suddenly struck like that some morning now&mdash;I
mean the Fair people!&rdquo; widening her eyes with
a little shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;Those things
have stopped happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;Sometimes I
wish they hadn&rsquo;t. If they hadn&rsquo;t, perhaps&mdash;perhaps
if we made burnt offerings, we might be
taken by a miracle to see the World&rsquo;s Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything to burn,&rdquo; said Rob, rather
gloomily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the chickens,&rdquo; Meg answered as
gloomily, &ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good. Miracles
are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is all different,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;You
have to do your miracle yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a miracle,&rdquo; Meg said, &ldquo;if we ever get
away from Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world, and live like
people instead of like pigs who are comfortable&mdash;and
we shall have to perform it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one else,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;You see,
there is no one else in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw out his hand and it clutched Meg&rsquo;s,
which was lying in the straw near him. He did
not know why he clutched it&mdash;he did not in the
least know why; nor did she know why a queer
sound in his voice suddenly made her feel their
unfriendedness in a way that overwhelmed her.
She found herself looking at him, with a hard
lump rising in her throat. It was one of the
rainy days, and the hollow drumming and patter
of the big drops on the roof seemed somehow to
shut them in with their loneliness away from all
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thing,&rdquo; she said, almost under
her breath, &ldquo;to be two children, only just twelve
years old, and to be quite by ourselves in such a
big world, where there are such millions and millions
of people all busy doing things and making
great plans, and none of them knowing about us,
or caring what we are going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we work our miracle ourselves,&rdquo; said Rob,
holding her hand quite tight, &ldquo;it will be better
than having it worked for us. Meg!&rdquo;&mdash;as if he
were beginning a new subject&mdash;&ldquo;Meg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she answered, still feeling the hard
lump in her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are going to stay here always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;oh, Robin, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do, then. We are <i>not</i>&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the
first step up the Hill of Difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">IV</span></h2>
<p>All their lives the children had acted in unison.
When they had been tiny creatures they had
played the same games and used the same toys.
It had seemed of little importance that their belongings
were those of a boy and girl. When
Robin had played with tops and marbles, Meg
had played with them too. When Meg had
been in a domestic and maternal mood, and had
turned to dolls and dolls&rsquo; housekeeping, Robin
had assumed some masculine r&ocirc;le connected with
the amusement. It had entertained him as much
at times to be the dolls&rsquo; doctor, or the carpenter
who repaired the dolls&rsquo; furniture or made plans
for the enlargement of the dolls&rsquo; house, as it had
entertained Meg to sew the flags and dress the
sailors who manned his miniature ships, and assist
him with the tails of his kites. They had had few
playmates, and had pleased each other far better
than outsiders could have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we are twins,&rdquo; Meg said. &ldquo;Twins
are made alike, and so they like the same things.
I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a twin. If I had to be born again
and be an <i>un</i>-twin I&rsquo;m sure I should be lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters whether you are a
boy or a girl, if you are a twin,&rdquo; said Robin.
&ldquo;You are part of the other one, and so it&rsquo;s as if
you were both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had never had secrets from each other.
They had read the same books as they grew
older, been thrilled by the same stories, and
shared in each other&rsquo;s plans and imaginings or
depressions. So it was a curious thing that at
this special time, when they were drawn nearest
to one another by an unusual interest and sympathy,
there should have arrived a morning when
each rose with a thought unshared by the other.</p>
<p>Aunt Matilda was very busy that day. She
was always busy, but this morning seemed more
actively occupied than usual. She never appeared
to sit down, unless to dispose of a hurried
meal or go over some accounts. She was a
wonderful woman, and the twins knew that the
most objectionable thing they could do was not
to remove themselves after a repast was over;
but this morning Meg walked over to a chair
and firmly sat down in it, and watched her as
she vigorously moved things about, rubbed dust
off them, and put them in their right places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on her very steadily.
She wondered if it was true that she and Robin
were like her, and if they would be more like her
when they had reached her age, and what would
have happened to them before that time came.
It was true that Aunt Matilda had a square jaw
also. It was not an encouraging thing to contemplate;
in fact, as she looked at her, Meg felt
her heart begin a slow and steady thumping.
But, as it thumped, she was getting herself in
hand with such determination that when she at
last spoke her chin looked very square indeed,
and her black-lashed eyes were as nearly stern
as a child&rsquo;s eyes can look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Matilda,&rdquo; she said, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; and a tablecloth was whisked off and
shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk in a hurry, then. I&rsquo;ve no time to waste
in talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old were you when you began to work
and make money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Matilda smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worked out for my board when I was ten
years old,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Me and your father were
left orphans, and we had to work, or starve. When
I was twelve I got a place to wash dishes and
look after children and run errands, and I got a
dollar a week because it was out in the country,
and girls wouldn&rsquo;t stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how old <i>I</i> am?&rdquo; asked Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twelve years old.&rdquo; She got up from her
chair and walked across the room and stood looking
up at Aunt Matilda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an orphan too, and
so is Robin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we have to work.
You give us a place to stay in; but&mdash;there are
other things. We have no one, and we have to
do things ourselves; and we are twelve, and
twelve is a good age for people who have to do
things for themselves. Is there anything in this
house or in the dairy or on the farm that would
be worth wages, that I could do? I don&rsquo;t care
how hard it is if I can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Aunt Matilda had been a woman of sentiment
she might have been moved by the odd, unchildish
tenseness and sternness of the little figure,
and the straight-gazing eyes, which looked up at
her from under the thick black hair tumbling in
short locks over the forehead. Twelve years old
was very young to stand and stare the world in
the face with such eyes. But she was not a
woman of sentiment, and her life had been spent
among people who knew their right to live could
only be won by hard work, and who began the
fight early. So she looked at the child without
any emotion whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose you could more than earn
your bread if I put you in the dairy and let you
help there?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Meg, unflinchingly, &ldquo;I know
I could. I&rsquo;m strong for my age, and I&rsquo;ve watched
them doing things there. I can wash pans and
bowls and cloths, and carry things about, and go
anywhere I&rsquo;m told. I know how clean things
have to be kept.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" alt="&ldquo;AUNT MATILDA,&rdquo; SHE SAID, SUDDENLY." width="600" height="777" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;AUNT MATILDA,&rdquo; SHE SAID, SUDDENLY.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aunt Matilda, looking her over
sharply, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been complaining about the
work being too much for them, lately. You go
in there this morning and see what you can do.
You shall have a dollar a week if you&rsquo;re worth it.
You&rsquo;re right about its being time that you should
begin earning something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Meg, and she turned
round and walked away in the direction of the
dairy, with two deep red spots on her cheeks and
her heart thumping again&mdash;though this time it
thumped quickly.</p>
<p>She reached the scene of action in the midst
of a rush of work, and after their first rather exasperated
surprise at so immature and inexperienced
a creature being supposed to be able to
help them, the women found plenty for her to
do. She said so few words and looked so little
afraid that she made a sort of impression on
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said to the head woman, &ldquo;Aunt
Matilda didn&rsquo;t send me to do things that need
teaching. Just tell me the little things, it does
not matter what, and I&rsquo;ll do them. I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>How she worked that morning&mdash;how she ran
on errands&mdash;how she carried this and that&mdash;how
she washed and scrubbed milk-pans&mdash;and how
all her tasks were menial and apparently trivial,
though entirely necessary, and how the activity
and rapidity and unceasingness of them tried her
unaccustomed young body, and finally made her
limbs ache and her back feel as if it might break
at some unexpected moment, Meg never forgot.
But such was the desperation of her indomitable
little spirit and the unconquerable will she had
been born with, that when it was over she was no
more in the mood for giving up than she had
been when she walked in among the workers after
her interview with Aunt Matilda.</p>
<p>When dinner-time came she walked up to Mrs.
Macartney, the manager of the dairy work, and
asked her a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I helped you?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; said the woman, who was by
no means an ill-natured creature for a hard-driven
woman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done first-rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell Aunt Matilda that?&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Meg was standing with her hands clasped
tightly behind her back, and she looked at Mrs.
Macartney very straight and hard from under
her black brows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Macartney,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m worth it,
Aunt Matilda will give me a dollar a week; and
it&rsquo;s time I began to work for my living. Am I
worth that much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; said Mrs. Macartney, &ldquo;if you
go on as you&rsquo;ve begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go on as I&rsquo;ve begun,&rdquo; said Meg.
&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and she walked back to the
house.</p>
<p>After dinner she waited to speak to Aunt Matilda
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the dairy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did,&rdquo; Aunt Matilda answered.
&ldquo;Mrs. Macartney told me about it. You can go
on. I&rsquo;ll give you the dollar a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked the child over again, as she had
done in the morning, but with a shade of expression
which might have meant a touch of added
interest. Perhaps her mind paused just long
enough to bring back to her the time when she
had been a worker at twelve years old, and also
had belonged to no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make her living,&rdquo; she said, as she
watched Meg out of the room. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s more like
me than she is like her father. Robert wasn&rsquo;t
worthless, but he had no push.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Having made quite sure that she was not
wanted in the dairy for the time being, Meg
made her way to the barn. She was glad to find
it empty, so that she could climb the ladder without
waiting. When she reached the top and
clambered over the straw the scent of it seemed
delightful to her. It was like something welcoming
her home. She threw herself down full length
in the Straw Parlor. Robin had not been at
dinner. He had gone out early and had not returned.
As she lay, stretching her tired limbs,
and staring up at the nest in the dark, tent-like
roof above her, she hoped he would come. And
he did. In about ten minutes she heard the
signal from the barn floor, and answered it.
Robin came up the ladder rather slowly. When
he made his way over the straw to her corner,
and threw himself down beside her, she saw that
he was tired too. They talked a few minutes
about ordinary things, and then Meg thought she
would tell him about the dairy. But it appeared
that he had something to tell himself, and he began
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making a plan, Meg,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for two or three
days,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t say
anything about it until&mdash;till I tried how it would
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg raised herself on her elbow and looked at
him curiously. It seemed so queer that he should
have had a plan too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you&mdash;tried?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have been working for
Jones this morning, and I did quite a lot. I
worked hard. I wanted him to see what I could
do. And then, Meg, I asked him if he would take
me on&mdash;like the rest of the hands&mdash;and pay me
what I was worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo; breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked at me a minute&mdash;all over&mdash;and half
laughed, and I thought he was going to say I
wasn&rsquo;t worth anything. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been
true, but I thought he might, because I&rsquo;m only
twelve years old. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to be only
twelve when you want to get work. But he
didn&rsquo;t, he said, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m darned if I won&rsquo;t
give you a show;&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m to have a dollar a
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; Meg cried, with a little gasp of excitement,
&ldquo;so am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are you!&rdquo; cried Robin, and sat bolt upright.
&ldquo;<i>You!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s because we are twins,&rdquo; said Meg, her
eyes shining like lamps. &ldquo;I told you twins did
things alike because they couldn&rsquo;t help it. We
have both thought of the same thing. I went to
Aunt Matilda, asked her to let me work somewhere
and pay me, and she let me go into the
dairy and try, and Mrs. Macartney said I was a
help, and I am to have a dollar a week, if I go on
as I&rsquo;ve begun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Robin&rsquo;s hand gave hers a clutch, just as it had
done before, that day when he had not known
why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg, I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe that we
two will always go on as we begin. I believe we
were born that way. We have to, we can&rsquo;t help
it. And two dollars a week, if they keep us, and
we save it all&mdash;we could go almost anywhere&mdash;sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on him with a searching,
but half frightened expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost anywhere,&rdquo; she said, quite in a whisper.
&ldquo;Anywhere not more than a hundred miles
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">V</span></h2>
<p>They did not tell each other of the strange and
bold thought which had leaped up in their minds
that day. Each felt an unwonted shyness about
it, perhaps because it had been so bold; but it had
been in each mind, and hidden though it was, it
remained furtively in both.</p>
<p>They went on exactly as they had begun.
Each morning Meg went to her drudgery in the
dairy and Robin followed Jones whithersoever
duty led. If the elder people had imagined they
would get tired and give up they found out their
mistake. That they were often tired was true,
but that in either there arose once the thought of
giving up, never! And they worked hard. The
things they did to earn their weekly stipend would
have touched the heart of a mother of cared-for
children, but on Mrs. Jennings&rsquo;s model farm people
knew how much work a human being could do
when necessity drove. They were all driven by
necessity, and it was nothing new to know that
muscles ached and feet swelled and burned. In
fact, they knew no one who did not suffer, as a
rule, from these small inconveniences. And these
children, with their set little faces and mature intelligence,
were somehow so unsuggestive of the
weakness and limitations of childhood that they
were often given work which was usually intrusted
only to elder people. Mrs. Macartney
found that Meg never slighted anything, never
failed in a task, and never forgot one, so she gave
her plenty to do. Scrubbing and scouring that
others were glad to shirk fell to her share. She
lifted and dragged things about that grown-up
girls grumbled over. What she lacked in muscle
and size she made up in indomitable will power
that made her small face set itself and her small
body become rigid as iron. Her work ended by
not confining itself to the dairy, but extended to
the house, the kitchen&mdash;anywhere there were tiresome
things to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>With Robin it was the same story. Jones was
not afraid to give him any order. He was of use
in all quarters&mdash;in the huge fields, in the barn,
in the stables, and as a messenger to be trusted
to trudge any distance when transport was not
available.</p>
<p>They both grew thin but sinewy looking, and
their faces had a rather strained look. Their always
large black eyes seemed to grow bigger,
and their little square jaws looked more square
every day; but on Saturday nights they each
were paid their dollar, and climbed to the Straw
Parlor and unburied the Treasure and added
to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Those Saturday nights were wonderful things.
To the end of life they would never forget them.
Through all the tired hours of labor they were
looked forward to. Then they lay in their nest
of straw and talked things over&mdash;there it seemed
that they could relax and rest their limbs as they
could do it nowhere else. Mrs. Jennings was not
given to sofas and easy-chairs, and it is not safe
to change position often when one has a grown-up
bedfellow. But in the straw they could roll
at full length, curl up or stretch out just as they
pleased, and there they could enlarge upon the
one subject that filled their minds, and fascinated
and enraptured them.</p>
<p>Who could wonder that it was so! The City
Beautiful was growing day by day, and the development
of its glories was the one thing they
heard talked of. Robin had established the habit
of collecting every scrap of newspaper referring
to it. He cut them out of Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s old
papers, he begged them from every one, neighbors,
store-keepers, work hands. When he was
sent on errands he cast an all-embracing glance
&rsquo;round every place his orders took him to. The
postmaster of the nearest village discovered his
weakness and saved paragraphs and whole papers
for him. Before very long there was buried near
the Treasure a treasure even more valuable of
newspaper cuttings, and on the wonderful Saturday
nights they gave themselves up to revelling
in them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>How they watched it and followed it and lived
with it&mdash;this great human scheme which somehow
seemed to their young minds more like the
scheme of giants and genii! How they seized
upon every new story of its wonders and felt that
there could be no limit to them! They knew
every purpose and plan connected with it&mdash;every
arch and tower and hall and stone they pleased
themselves by fancying. Newspapers were liberal
with information, people talked of it, they heard
of it on every side. To them it seemed that the
whole world must be thinking of nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we are lying here,&rdquo; Meg said&mdash;&ldquo;while
you are doing chores, and I am scouring pans
and scrubbing things, it is all going on. People
in France and in England and in Italy are doing
work to send to it&mdash;artists are painting pictures,
and machinery is whirling and making things,
and everything is pouring into that one wonderful
place. And men and women planned it, you
know&mdash;just men and women. And if we live a
few years we shall be men and women, and they
were once children like us&mdash;only, if they had been
quite like us they would never have known
enough to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;But when they were children like us,&rdquo; said
Robin, &ldquo;they did not know what they would
have learned by this time&mdash;and they never
dreamed about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows how wonderful men and women
are,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;I believe they can do <i>anything</i>
if they set their minds to it.&rdquo; And she said it
stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they can,&rdquo; said Robin, slowly. &ldquo;Perhaps
<i>we</i> could do anything we set our minds to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the suggestive tone in his voice
which Meg had been thrilled by more than once
before. She had been thrilled by it most strongly
when he had said that if they saved their two
dollars a week they might be able to go almost
anywhere. Unconsciously she responded to it
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could do anything I set my mind to,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;do you know what I would set my mind to
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would set my mind to going to that wonderful
place. I would set it to seeing everything
there, and remembering all I could hold, and
learning all there was to be learned&mdash;and I would
<i>set it hard</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>It was a more suggestive voice than before that
he said the words in; and suddenly he got up,
and went and tore away the straw from the burying-place
of the Treasure. He took out the old
iron bank, and brought it back to their corner.</p>
<p>He did it so suddenly, and with such a determined
air, that Meg rather lost her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with the Treasure?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to count it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was opening the box, using the blade of a
stout pocket-knife as a screwdriver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A return ticket to Chicago costs fourteen
dollars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I asked at the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t. That
would be twenty-eight dollars for two people.
Any one who is careful can live on a very little
for a while. I want to see if we shall have money
enough to <i>go</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>go</i>!&rdquo; Meg cried out. &ldquo;To the Fair,
Robin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not believe the evidence of her ears&mdash;it
sounded so daring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody would take us!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even if
we had money enough to pay for ourselves, nobody
would take us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take!&rdquo; answered Robin, working at his
screws. &ldquo;No, nobody would. What&rsquo;s the matter
with taking ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg sat up in the straw, conscious of a sort of
shock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;To go by ourselves, like grown-up people!
To buy our tickets ourselves, and get on the train,
and go all the way&mdash;alone! And walk about the
Fair alone, Robin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who takes care of us here?&rdquo; answered Robin.
&ldquo;Who has looked after us ever since father and
mother died? Ourselves! Just ourselves! Whose
business are we but our own? Who thinks of us,
or asks if we are happy or unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said Meg. And she hid her face in
her arms on her knees.</p>
<p>Robin went on stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is ever going to do it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if
we live to be hundreds of years old. I&rsquo;ve thought
of it when I&rsquo;ve been working in the fields with
Jones, and I&rsquo;ve thought of it when I&rsquo;ve been lying
awake at night. It&rsquo;s kept me awake many and
many a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it has me,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And since this thing began to be talked about
everywhere, I&rsquo;ve thought of it more and more,&rdquo;
said Rob. &ldquo;It means more to people like us than
it does to any one else. It&rsquo;s the people who never
see things, who have no chances, it means the
most to. And the more I think of it, the more I&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t let it go by me!&rdquo; And all at once he
threw himself face downward on the straw, and
hid his face in his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Meg lifted hers. There was something in the
woful desperation of his movement that struck
her to the heart. She had never known him do
such a thing in their lives before. That was not
his way. Whatsoever hard thing had happened&mdash;howsoever
lonely and desolate they had felt&mdash;he
had never shown his feeling in this way. She
put out her hand and touched his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, Robin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he said, from the refuge of his
sleeves. &ldquo;We <i>are</i> little when we are compared
with grown-up people. They would call us children;
and children usually have some one to help
them and tell them what to do. I&rsquo;m only like
this because I&rsquo;ve been thinking so much and
working so hard&mdash;and it does seem like an Enchanted
City&mdash;but no one ever thinks we could
care about anything more than if we were cats
and dogs. It was not like that at home, even if
we were poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he sat up with as little warning as he had
thrown himself down, and gave his eyes a fierce
rub. He returned to the Treasure again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making up my mind to it for days,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;If we have the money we can buy our
tickets and go some night without saying anything
to any one. We can leave a note for Aunt
Matilda, and tell her we are all right and we are
coming back. She&rsquo;ll be too busy to mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that book of father&rsquo;s we
read?&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;That one called &lsquo;David Copperfield.&rsquo;
David ran away from the bottle place
when he was younger than we are, and he had to
walk all the way to Dover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not have to walk; and we won&rsquo;t let
any one take our money away from us,&rdquo; said
Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going, really?&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;You
speak as if we were truly going; and it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you said just now about
believing human beings could do <i>anything</i>, if they
set their minds to it? Let&rsquo;s set our minds to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Meg answered, rather slowly, as if
weighing the matter, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she fell to helping to count the Treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">VI</span></h2>
<p>Afterwards, when they looked back upon that
day, they knew that the thing had decided itself
then, though neither of them had said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth was,&rdquo; Robin used to say, &ldquo;we had
both been thinking the same thing, as we always
do, but we had been thinking it in the back part
of our minds. We were afraid to let it come to
the front at first, because it seemed such a big
thing. But it went on thinking by itself. That
time, when you said &lsquo;We shall <i>never</i> see it,&rsquo; and I
said, &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; we were both thinking
about it in one way; and I know I was thinking
about it when I said, &lsquo;We are not going to stay
here always. That is the first step up the Hill of
Difficulty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that day when you said you would not
let it go by you,&rdquo; Meg would answer, &ldquo;that was
the day we reached the Wicket Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>It seemed very like it, for from that day their
strange, unchildish purpose grew and ripened,
and never for an hour was absent from the mind
of either. If they had been like other children,
living happy lives, full of young interests and
pleasures, it might have been crossed out by other
and newer things; if they had been of a slighter
mental build, and less strong, they might have
forgotten it; but they never did. When they had
counted the Treasure, and had realized how small
it was after all, they had sat and gazed at each
other for a while with grave eyes, but they had
only been grave, and not despairing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;Well,
that&rsquo;s not much after nearly six years; but we
saved it nearly all by cents, you know, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it takes a hundred cents to make a
dollar,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;and we were poor people&rsquo;s
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we bought the chickens,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have always given me a present at
Christmas, Robin, even if it <i>was</i> only a little one.
That&rsquo;s six Christmases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have eight months to work in,&rdquo; said
Robin, calculating. &ldquo;If you get four dollars a
month, and I get four, that will be sixty-four dollars
by next June. Twenty-five dollars and sixty-four
dollars make eighty-nine. Eighty-nine dollars
for us to live on and go to see all the things;
because we must see them all, if we go. And I
suppose we shall have to come back&rdquo;&mdash;with a
long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Meg, &ldquo;how <i>can</i> we come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;We shall hate
it, but we have nowhere else to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we are going to seek our fortunes,
and perhaps we shall find them,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;or
perhaps Aunt Matilda won&rsquo;t let us come back.
Rob,&rdquo; with some awe, &ldquo;do you think she will be
angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about that,&rdquo; Robin answered
contemplatively, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think she will. She
would be too busy to care much even if we ran
away and said nothing. But I shall leave a letter,
and tell her we have saved our money and gone
somewhere for a holiday, and we&rsquo;re all right, and
she need not bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t bother even if she is angry,&rdquo; Meg
said, with mournful eyes. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care
about us enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she loved us,&rdquo; Rob said, &ldquo;and was too poor
to take us herself, we couldn&rsquo;t go at all. We
couldn&rsquo;t run away, because it would worry her
so. You can&rsquo;t do a thing, however much you
want to do it, if it is going to hurt somebody who
is good to you, and cares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we needn&rsquo;t stay here because of
Aunt Matilda,&rdquo; said Meggy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one sure
thing. It wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with her ploughing
if we were both to die at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rob, deliberately, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what
it would <i>not</i>.&rdquo; And he threw himself back on the
straw and clasped his hands under his head, gazing
up into the dark roof above him with very
reflective eyes.</p>
<p>But they had reached the Wicket Gate, and
from the hour they passed it there was no looking
back. That in their utter friendlessness and loneliness
they should take their twelve-year-old fates
in their own strong little hands was, perhaps, a
pathetic thing; that once having done so they
moved towards their object as steadily as if they
had been of the maturest years was remarkable,
but no one ever knew or even suspected the first
until the last.</p>
<p>The days went by, full of work, which left them
little time to lie and talk in the Straw Parlor.
They could only see each other in the leisure
hours, which were so few, and only came when
the day was waning. Finding them faithful and
ready, those about them fell into the natural, easy,
human unworthiness of imposing by no means
infrequently on their inexperienced willingness
and youth. So they were hard enough worked,
but each felt that every day that passed brought
them nearer to the end in view; and there was
always something to think of, some detail to be
worked out mentally, or to be discussed, in the
valuable moments when they were together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great deal better than it used to be,&rdquo;
Meg said, &ldquo;at all events. It&rsquo;s better to feel tired
by working than to be tired of doing nothing but
think and think dreary things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the weather grew colder it was hard enough
to keep warm in their hiding-place. They used
to sit and talk, huddled close together, bundled
in their heaviest clothing, and with the straw
heaped close around them and over them.</p>
<p>There were so many things to be thought of
and talked over! Robin collected facts more
sedulously than ever&mdash;facts about entrance fees,
facts about prices of things to eat, facts about
places to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to the Fair yourself, sonny?&rdquo; Jones
said to him one day. Jones was fond of his joke.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right to be inquirin&rsquo; round. Them hotel-keepers
is given to tot up bills several stories
higher than their hotels is themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I suppose a person needn&rsquo;t go to a hotel,&rdquo;
said Robin. &ldquo;There must be plenty of poor people
who can&rsquo;t go to hotels, and they&rsquo;ll have to
sleep somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s plenty of poor people,&rdquo; responded
Jones, cheerfully, &ldquo;plenty of &rsquo;em. Always is.
But they won&rsquo;t go to Chicago while the Fair&rsquo;s
on. They&rsquo;ll sleep at home&mdash;that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; Rob said to Meg afterwards;
&ldquo;you see, we have to sleep <i>somewhere</i>.
We could live on bread and milk or crackers and
cheese&mdash;or oatmeal&mdash;but we have to <i>sleep</i> somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be warm weather,&rdquo; Meg said, reflectively.
&ldquo;Perhaps we could sleep out of doors.
Beggars do. We don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the police would let us,&rdquo; Robin
answered. &ldquo;If they would&mdash;perhaps we might
have to, some night; but we are going to that
place, Meg&mdash;we are <i>going</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, they believed they were going, and lived
on the belief. This being decided, howsoever
difficult to attain, it was like them both that they
should dwell upon the dream, and revel in it in
a way peculiarly their own. It was Meg whose
imagination was the stronger, and it is true that
it was always she who made pictures in words
and told stories. But Robin was always as ready
to enter into the spirit of her imaginings as she
was to talk about them. There was a word he
had once heard his father use which had caught
his fancy, in fact, it had attracted them both, and
they applied it to this favorite pleasure of theirs
of romancing with everyday things. The word
was &ldquo;philander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we have finished adding up and making
plans,&rdquo; he would say, putting his ten-cent
account-book into his pocket, &ldquo;let us philander
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>And then Meg would begin to talk about the
City Beautiful&mdash;a City Beautiful which was a
wonderful and curious mixture of the enchanted
one the whole world was pouring its treasures
into, one hundred miles away, and that City
Beautiful of her own which she had founded
upon the one towards which Christian had toiled
through the Slough of Despond and up the Hill
of Difficulty and past Doubting Castle. Somehow
one could scarcely tell where one ended and
the others began, they were so much alike, these
three cities&mdash;Christian&rsquo;s, Meg&rsquo;s, and the fair,
ephemeral one the ending of the nineteenth century
had built upon the blue lake&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must look alike,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;I am
sure they must. See what it says in the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now just as the gates were
opened to let in the men, I looked in after them,
and behold, the City shone like the sun&rsquo;&mdash;and
then it says, &lsquo;The talk they had with the Shining
Ones was about the glory of the place; who told
them that the beauty and glory of it were inexpressible.&rsquo;
I always think of it, Robin, when I
read about those places like white palaces and
temples and towers that are being built. I am so
glad they are white. Think how the City will
&lsquo;shine like the sun&rsquo; when it stands under the
blue sky and by the blue water, on a sunshiny
day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>They had never read the dear old worn &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress&rdquo; as they did in those days.
They kept it in the straw near the Treasure, and
always had it at hand to refer to. In it they
seemed to find parallels for everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world is the City of Destruction,&rdquo;
they would say. &ldquo;And our loneliness and
poorness are like Christian&rsquo;s &lsquo;burden.&rsquo; We have
to carry it like a heavy weight, and it holds us
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it that Goodwill said to Christian
about it?&rdquo; Robin asked.</p>
<p>Meg turned over the pages. She knew all the
places by heart. It was easy enough to find and
read how &ldquo;At last there came a grave person to
the gate, named Goodwill,&rdquo; and in the end he
said, &ldquo;As to thy burden, be content to bear it
until thou comest to the place of deliverance; for
there it will fall from thy back itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But out of the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo;&rdquo; Robin
said, with his reflecting air, &ldquo;burdens don&rsquo;t fall
off by themselves. If you are content with them
they stick on and get bigger. Ours would, I
know. You have to do something yourself to
get them off. But&mdash;&rdquo; with a little pause for
thought, &ldquo;I like that part, Meg. And I like
Goodwill, because he told it to him. It encouraged
him, you know. You see it says next, &lsquo;Then
Christian began to gird up his loins and address
himself to his journey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; said Meg, suddenly shutting the book
and giving it a little thump on the back, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not
only Christian&rsquo;s City that is like our City. <i>We</i>
are like Christian. We are pilgrims, and our
way to that place is our Pilgrims&rsquo; Progress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">VII</span></h2>
<p>And the cold days of hard work kept going by,
and the City Beautiful grew, and, huddled close
together in the straw, the children planned and
dreamed, and read and re-read the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress,&rdquo; following Christian step by step. And
Aunt Matilda became busier every day, it seemed,
and did not remember that they were alive except
when she saw them. And nobody guessed
and nobody knew.</p>
<p>Days so quickly grow to weeks, and weeks
slip by so easily until they are months, and at
last there came a time when Meg, going out in
the morning, felt a softer air, and stopped a moment
by a bare tree to breathe it in and feel its
lovely touch upon her cheek. She turned her
face upward with a half-involuntary movement,
and found herself looking at such a limitless vault
of tender blueness that her heart gave a quick
throb, seemed to spring up to it, and carry her
with it. For a moment it seemed as if she had
left the earth far below, and was soaring in the
soft depths of blueness themselves. And suddenly,
even as she felt it, she heard on the topmost
branch of the bare tree a brief little rapturous
trill, and her heart gave a leap again, and she
felt her cheeks grow warm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bluebird,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is a bluebird.
And it is the spring, and that means that the time
is quite near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had a queer little smile on her face all day
as she worked. She did not know it was there
herself, but Mrs. Macartney saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s pleasing you so, Meggy, my girl?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>Meg wakened up with a sort of start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the woman, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;You look as if you were thinking
over a secret, and it was a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening it was not cold when they sat in
the Straw Parlor, and Meg told Robin about the
bluebird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me a strange feeling to hear it,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It seemed as if it was speaking to me.
It said, &lsquo;You must get ready. It is quite near.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had made up their minds that they would
go in June, before the weather became so hot
that they might suffer from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we have to consider everything,&rdquo;
was Robin&rsquo;s idea. &ldquo;We shall be walking about
all the time, and we have no cool clothes, and we
shall have no money to buy cool things; and if
we should be ill, it would be worse for us than
for children who have some one with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>In the little account-book they had calculated
all they should own on the day their pilgrimage
began. They had apportioned it all out:
so much for the price of the railroad tickets,
so much for entrance fees, and&mdash;not so much,
but so little&mdash;oh, so little!&mdash;for their food and
lodging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have listened when Jones and the others
were talking,&rdquo; said Robin; &ldquo;and they say that
everybody who has room to spare, and wants to
make money, is going to let every corner they
have. So you see there will be sure to be people
who have quite poor places that they would be
obliged to rent cheap to people who are poor,
like themselves. We will go through the small
side streets and look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first bluebird came again, day after day,
and others came with it, until the swift dart of
blue wings through the air and the delicious
ripple of joyous sound were no longer rare
things. The days grew warmer, and the men
threw off their coats, and began to draw their
shirt-sleeves across their foreheads when they
were at work.</p>
<p>One evening when Robin came up into the
Straw Parlor he brought something with him.
It was a battered old tin coffee-pot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo; asked Meg; for he seemed
to carry it as if it was of some value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old and rusty, but there are no holes in
it,&rdquo; Robin answered. &ldquo;I saw it lying in a fence
corner, where some one had thrown it&mdash;perhaps
a tramp. And it put a new thought into my
head. It will do to boil eggs in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eggs!&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much nicer than hard-boiled
eggs,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;and you can carry them
about with you. It just came into my mind that
we could take some of our eggs, and go somewhere
where no one would be likely to see us,
and build a fire of sticks, and boil some eggs, and
carry them with us to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; cried Meg, with admiring ecstasy,
&ldquo;I wish I had thought of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter which of us thought of it,&rdquo;
said Rob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>So it was decided that when the time came
they should boil their supply of eggs very hard,
and roll them up in pieces of paper and tuck
them away carefully in the one small bag which
was to carry all their necessary belongings.
These belongings would be very few&mdash;just enough
to keep them decent and clean, and a brush and
comb between them. They used to lie in bed at
night, with beating hearts, thinking it all over,
sometimes awakening in a cold perspiration from
a dreadful dream, in which Aunt Matilda or Jones
or some of the hands had discovered their secret
and confronted them with it in all its daring.
They were so full of it night and day that Meg
used to wonder that the people about them did
not see it in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not thinking of us,&rdquo; said Robin.
&ldquo;They are thinking about crops. I dare say
Aunt Matilda would like to see the Agricultural
Building, but she couldn&rsquo;t waste the time to go
through the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, what a day it was, what a thrilling, exciting,
almost unbearably joyful day, when Robin
gathered sticks and dried bits of branches, and
piled them in a corner of a field far enough from
the house and outbuildings to be quite safe! He
did it one noon hour, and as he passed Meg on
his way back to his work, he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got the sticks for the fire all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after supper they crept out to the place,
with matches, and the battered old coffee-pot,
and the eggs.</p>
<p>As they made their preparations, they found
themselves talking in whispers, though there was
not the least chance of any one&rsquo;s hearing them.
Meg looked rather like a little witch as she stood
over the bubbling old pot, with her strange,
little dark face and shining eyes and black elf
locks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like making a kind of sacrifice on an
altar,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always think queer things about everything,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re all
right; I don&rsquo;t think of them myself, but I like
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the eggs were boiled hard enough they
carried them to the barn and hid them in the
Straw Parlor, near the Treasure. Then they sat
and talked, in whispers still, almost trembling
with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, do you know,&rdquo; Meg said, &ldquo;it feels
as if we were going to do something more than
just go to the Fair. When people in stories go
to seek their fortunes, I&rsquo;m sure they feel like this.
Does it give you a kind of creeping in your
stomach whenever you think of it, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; Robin whispered back; &ldquo;and
when it comes into my mind suddenly something
gives a queer jump inside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your heart,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;Robin, if
anything should stop us, I believe I should drop
<i>dead</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Rob&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s better not to let ourselves think about it.
And I don&rsquo;t believe anything as bad as that <i>could</i>
happen. We&rsquo;ve worked so hard, and we have nobody
but ourselves, and it can&rsquo;t do any one any
harm&mdash;and we don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to do any one any harm.
No, there must be <i>something</i> that wouldn&rsquo;t let
it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">MEG LOOKED RATHER LIKE A LITTLE WITCH.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that too,&rdquo; said Meg, and this time it
was she who clutched at Robin&rsquo;s hand; but he
seemed glad she did, and held as close as she.</p>
<p>And then, after the bluebirds had sung a few
times more, there came a night when Meg crept
out of her cot after she was sure that the woman
in the other bed was sleeping heavily enough.
Every one went to bed early, and every one slept
through the night in heavy, tired sleep. Too
much work was done on the place to allow people
to waste time in sleeplessness. Meg knew no one
would waken as she crept down stairs to the lower
part of the house and softly opened the back door.</p>
<p>Robin was standing outside, with the little
leather satchel in his hand. It was a soft, warm
night, and the dark blue sky was full of the glitter
of stars.</p>
<p>Both he and Meg stood still a moment, and
looked up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; Meg said;
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t seem so lonely. Is your heart thumping,
Robin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather,&rdquo; whispered Robin. &ldquo;I left the
letter in a place where Aunt Matilda will be likely
to find it some time to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Meg whispered back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I told you I was going to. There
wasn&rsquo;t much to say. Just told her we had saved
our money, and gone away for a few days; and
we were all right, and she needn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything was very still about them. There
was no moon, and, but for the stars, it would
have been very dark. As it was, the stillness of
night and sleep, and the sombreness of the hour,
might have made less strong little creatures feel
timid and alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take hold of each other&rsquo;s hands as we
walk along,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;It will make us feel
nearer, and&mdash;and <i>twinner</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, hand in hand, they went out on the
road together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">VIII</span></h2>
<p>It was four miles to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, but they were
good walkers. Robin hung the satchel on a
stick over his shoulder; they kept in the middle
of the road and walked smartly. There were not
many trees, but there were a few, occasionally,
and it was pleasanter to walk where the way before
them was quite clear. And somehow they
found themselves still talking in whispers, though
there was certainly no one to overhear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us talk about Christian,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;It
will not seem so lonely if we are talking. I wish
we could meet Evangelist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we knew he was Evangelist when we met
him,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t know him, we
should think he was some one who would stop us.
And after all, you see, he only showed Christian
the shining light, and told him to go to it. And
we are farther on than that. We have passed the
Wicket Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing we want,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;is the Roll
to read as we go on, and find out what we are
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>And then they talked of what was before them.
They wondered who would be at the little d&eacute;p&ocirc;t
and if they would be noticed, and of what the
ticket-agent would think when Robin bought the
tickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he won&rsquo;t notice me at all,&rdquo; said Rob.
&ldquo;And he does not know me. Somebody might
be sending us alone, you know. We are not <i>little</i>
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; responded Meg, courageously.
&ldquo;If we were six years old it would be different.
But we are twelve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did make it seem less lonely to be talking,
and so they did not stop. And there was so much
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; broke forth Meg once, giving his
hand a sudden clutch, &ldquo;we are on the way&mdash;we
are <i>going</i>. Soon we shall be in the train and it
will be carrying us nearer and nearer. Suppose
it was a dream, and we should wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a dream!&rdquo; said Rob, stoutly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
real&mdash;it&rsquo;s as real as Aunt Matilda!&rdquo; He was always
more practical-minded than Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t philander any more,&rdquo; Meg said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t philandering to talk about a real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rob, just think of it&mdash;waiting for us under
the stars, this very moment&mdash;the City Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>And then, walking close to each other in the
dimness, they told each other how they saw it in
imagination, and what its wonders would be to
them, and which they would see first, and how
they would remember it all their lives afterwards,
and have things to talk of and think of. Very
few people would see it as they would, but they
did not know that. It was not a gigantic enterprise
to them, a great scheme fought for and
struggled over for the divers reasons poor humanity
makes for itself; that it would either make or
lose money was not a side of the question that
reached them. They only dwelt on the beauty
and wonder of it, which made it seem like an enchanted
thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep thinking of the white palaces, and that
it is like a fairy story,&rdquo; Meg said, &ldquo;and that it
will melt away like those cities travellers sometimes
see in the desert. And I wish it wouldn&rsquo;t.
But it will have been real for a while, and everybody
will remember it. I am so glad it is beautiful&mdash;and
white. I am <i>so</i> glad it is white, Robin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I keep thinking,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;of all the
people who have made the things to go in it,
and how they have worked and invented. There
have been some people, perhaps, who have worked
months and months making one single thing&mdash;just
as we have worked to go to see it. And perhaps,
at first they were afraid they couldn&rsquo;t do it, and
they set their minds to it as we did, and tried and
tried, and then did it at last. I like to think of
those men and women, Meg, because, when the
City has melted away, the things won&rsquo;t melt.
They will last after the people. And we are
<i>people</i> too. I&rsquo;m a man, and you are a woman, you
know, though we are only twelve, and it gives
me a strong feeling to think of those others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes you think that perhaps men and
women <i>can</i> do anything if they set their minds
to it,&rdquo; said Meg, quite solemnly. &ldquo;Oh, I do like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it better than anything else in the world,&rdquo;
said Rob. &ldquo;Stop a minute, Meg. Come here in
the shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the last words quickly, and pulled her
to the roadside, where a big tree grew which
threw a deep shadow. He stood listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wheels!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There is a
buggy coming. We mustn&rsquo;t let any one see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a buggy, they could tell that by the
lightness of the wheels, and it was coming rapidly.
They could hear voices&mdash;men&rsquo;s voices&mdash;and
they drew back and stood very close to each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they have found out, and sent
some one after us?&rdquo; whispered Meg, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Robin, though his heart beat
like a triphammer. &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wheels drew nearer, and they heard one of
the men speaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago by sunrise,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;and
what I don&rsquo;t see of it won&rsquo;t be worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next minute the fast-trotting horse spun
swiftly down the road, and carried the voices out
of hearing. Meg and Robin drew twin sighs of
relief. Robin spoke first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is some one who is going to the Fair,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall see him in the train,&rdquo; said
Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say we shall,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;It was
nobody who knows us. I didn&rsquo;t know his voice.
Meg, let&rsquo;s take hands again, and walk quickly;
we might lose the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not talk much more, but walked
briskly. They had done a good day&rsquo;s work before
they set out, and were rather tired, but they
did not lag on that account. Sometimes Meg
took a turn at carrying the satchel, so that
Robin might rest his arm. It was not heavy,
and she was as strong for a girl as he was for a
boy.</p>
<p>At last they reached the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t. There were
a number of people waiting on the platform to
catch the train to Chicago, and there were several
vehicles outside. They passed one which
was a buggy, and Meg gave Robin a nudge with
her elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that belongs to our man,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>There were people enough before the office to
give the ticket-agent plenty to do. Robin&rsquo;s heart
quickened a little as he passed by with the group
of maturer people, but no one seemed to observe
him particularly, and he returned to Meg with
the precious bits of pasteboard held very tight in
his hand.</p>
<p>Meg had waited alone in an unlighted corner,
and when she saw him coming she came forward
to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got them?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did any
one look at you or say anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I got them,&rdquo; Robin answered. &ldquo;And, I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, Meg, these people are nearly all
going just where we are going, and they are so
busy thinking about it, and attending to themselves,
that they haven&rsquo;t any time to watch any
one else. That&rsquo;s one good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the nearer we get to Chicago,&rdquo; Meg said,
&ldquo;the more people there will be, and the more they
will have to think of. And at that beautiful place,
where there is so much to see, who will look at
two children? I don&rsquo;t believe we shall have any
trouble at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It really did not seem likely that they would,
but it happened, by a curious coincidence, that
within a very few minutes they saw somebody
looking at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The train was not due for ten minutes, and
there were a few people who, being too restless
to sit in the waiting-rooms, walked up and down
on the platform. Most of these were men, and
there were two men who walked farther than
the others did, and so neared the place where
Robin and Meg stood in the shadow. One was
a young man, and seemed to be listening to instructions
his companion, who was older, was
giving him, in a rapid, abrupt sort of voice.
This companion, who might have been his employer,
was a man of middle age. He was robust
of figure and had a clean-cut face, with a
certain effect of strong good looks. It was, perhaps,
rather a hard face, but it was a face one
would look at more than once; and he too, oddly
enough, had a square jaw and straight black
brows. But it was his voice which first attracted
Robin and Meg as he neared them, talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the man in the buggy,&rdquo; whispered Robin.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know his voice again?&rdquo; and they
watched him with deep interest.</p>
<p>He passed them once, without seeming to see
them at all. He was explaining something to his
companion. The second time he drew near he
chanced to look up, and his eye fell on them. It
did not rest on them more than a second, and he
went on speaking. The next time he neared
their part of the platform he turned his glance
towards them, as they stood close together. It
was as if involuntarily he glanced to see if they
were still where they had been before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;A pair of children,&rdquo; they heard him say, as if
the fleeting impression of their presence arrested
his train of thought for a second. &ldquo;Look as if no
one was with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He merely made the comment in passing, and
returned to his subject the next second; but Meg
and Robin heard him, and drew farther back into
the shadow.</p>
<p>But it was not necessary to stand there much
longer. They heard a familiar sound in the distance,
the shrill cry of the incoming train&mdash;the
beloved giant who was to carry them to fairyland;
the people began to flock out of the waiting-rooms
with packages and valises and umbrellas
in hand; the porters suddenly became
alert, and hurried about attending to their duties;
the delightful roar drew nearer and louder, and
began to shake the earth; it grew louder still, a
bell began to make a cheerful tolling, people were
rushing to and fro; Meg and Robin rushed with
them, and the train was panting in the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>It was even more thrilling than the children
had thought it would be. They had travelled so
very little, and did not know exactly where to
go. It might not be the right train even. They
did not know how long it would wait. It might
rush away again before they could get on. People
seemed in such a hurry and so excited. As they
hurried along they found themselves being pushed
and jostled, before the steps of one of the cars
a conductor stood, whom people kept showing
tickets to. There were several persons round
him when Robin and Meg reached the place
where he stood. People kept asking him things,
and sometimes he passed them on, and sometimes
let them go into his car.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/img006.jpg" alt="&ldquo;IS THIS THE TRAIN TO CHICAGO?&rdquo; SAID ROBIN." width="600" height="783" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;IS THIS THE TRAIN TO CHICAGO?&rdquo; SAID ROBIN.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the train to Chicago?&rdquo; said Robin,
breathlessly.</p>
<p>But he was so much less than the other people,
and the man was so busy, he did not hear him.</p>
<p>Robin tried to get nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the Chicago train, sir?&rdquo; he said, a little
louder.</p>
<p>He had had to press by a man whom he had
been too excited to see, and the man looked
down, and spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago train?&rdquo; he said, in a voice which was
abrupt, without being ill-natured. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re
all right. Got your sleeping tickets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin looked up at him quickly. He knew
the voice, and was vaguely glad to hear it. He
and Meg had never been in a sleeping-car in their
lives, and he did not quite understand. He held
out his tickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to sleep on the train,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but we have nothing but these.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next car but two, then,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d
better hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when both voices thanked him at once,
and the two caught each other&rsquo;s hands and ran
towards their car, he looked after them and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if they&rsquo;re not by themselves,&rdquo; he
said, watching them as they scrambled up the
steps. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re going to the Fair, I&rsquo;ll bet a
dollar. <i>That&rsquo;s Young America</i>, and no mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">IX</span></h2>
<p>The car was quite crowded. There were more
people than themselves who were going to the
Fair and were obliged to economize. When the
children entered, and looked about them in the
dim light, they thought at first that all the seats
were full. People seemed to be huddled up
asleep or sitting up awake in all of them. Everybody
had been trying to get to sleep, at least, and
the twins found themselves making their whispers
even lower than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is a seat empty just behind that
very fat lady,&rdquo; Meg whispered.</p>
<p>It was at the end of the car, and they went to
it, and found she was right. They took possession
of it quietly, putting their satchel under the
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so still,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;I feel as if I was
in somebody&rsquo;s bedroom. The sound of the wheels
makes it seem all the quieter. It&rsquo;s as if we were
shut in by the noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;or we shall
waken the people. Can you go to sleep, Meg?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can if I can stop thinking,&rdquo; she answered,
with a joyful sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very tired; but the
wheels keep saying, over and over again, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re
going&mdash;we&rsquo;re going&mdash;we&rsquo;re going.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just as if
they were talking. Don&rsquo;t you hear them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Do they say that to you, too?
But we mustn&rsquo;t listen,&rdquo; Robin whispered back.
&ldquo;If we do we shall not go to sleep, and then we
shall be too tired to walk about. Let&rsquo;s put our
heads down, and shut our eyes, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>She curled herself up on the seat, and put her
head into the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you lean against me, Rob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it
will be softer. We can take turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They changed position a little two or three
times, but they were worn out with the day&rsquo;s
work, and their walk, and the excitement, and the
motion of the train seemed like a sort of rocking
which lulled them. Gradually their muscles relaxed
and they settled down, though, after they
had done so, Meg spoke once, drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you see that was our
man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Rob, very sleepily indeed,
&ldquo;and he looked as if he knew us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>If they had been less young, or if they had been
less tired, they might have found themselves
awake a good many times during the night. But
they were such children, and, now that the great
step was taken, were so happy, that the soft, deep
sleepiness of youth descended upon and overpowered
them. Once or twice during the night
they stirred, wakened for a dreamy, blissful moment
by some sound of a door shutting, or a conductor
passing through. But they were only
conscious of a delicious sense of strangeness, of
the stillness of the car full of sleepers, of the half-realized
delight of feeling themselves carried
along through the unknown country, and of the
rattle of the wheels, which never ceased saying
rhythmically, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going&mdash;we&rsquo;re going&mdash;we&rsquo;re
going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! what a night of dreams and new, vague
sensations, to be remembered always! Ah! that
heavenly sense of joy to come, and adventure,
and young hopefulness and imagining! Were
there many others carried towards the City Beautiful
that night who bore with them the same
rapture of longing and belief; who saw with such
innocent clearness only the fair and splendid
thought which had created it, and were so innocently
blind to any shadow of sordidness or mere
worldly interest touching its white walls? And
after the passing of this wonderful night, what a
wakening in the morning, at the first rosiness of
dawn, when all the other occupants of the car
were still asleep, or restlessly trying to be at ease!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>It was as if they both wakened at almost the
same moment. The first shaft of early sunlight
streaming in the window touched Meg&rsquo;s eyelids,
and she slowly opened them. Then something
joyous and exultant rushed in upon her heart,
and she sat upright. And Robin sat up too, and
they looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Day, Meg!&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
Day!&rdquo; Meg caught her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing has stopped us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
we are getting nearer and nearer. Rob, let us
look out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while they looked out, pressed close together,
and full of such ecstasy of delight in the
strangeness of everything that at first they did
not exchange even their whispers.</p>
<p>It is rather a good thing to see&mdash;rather well
worth while even for a man or woman&mdash;the day
waking, and waking the world, as one is borne
swiftly through the morning light, and one looks
out of a car window. What it was to these two
children only those who remember the children
who were themselves long ago can realize at all.
The country went hurrying past them, making
curious sudden revelations and giving half-hints
in its haste; prairie and field, farmhouse and
wood and village all wore a strange, exciting,
vanishing aspect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; Meg said, &ldquo;as if it was all going
somewhere&mdash;in a great hurry&mdash;as if it couldn&rsquo;t
wait to let us see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are the ones that are going,&rdquo; said
Rob. &ldquo;Listen to the wheels&mdash;and we shall soon
be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while the people who were asleep began
to stir and stretch themselves. Some of them
looked cross, and some looked tired. The very
fat lady in the seat before them had a coal smut
on her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; said Meg, after looking at her seriously
a moment, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get our towel out of the
bag and wet it and wash our faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had taken the liberty of borrowing a
towel from Aunt Matilda. It was Meg who had
thought of it, and it had, indeed, been an inspiration.
Robin wetted two corners of it, and they
made a rigorous if limited toilet. At least they
had no smuts on their noses, and after a little
touching up with the mutual comb and brush,
they looked none the worse for wear. Their plain
and substantial garments were not of the order
which has any special charm to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not our clothes that are going to the
Fair,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s <i>us</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>And by the time they were in good order, the
farms and villages they were flying past had
grown nearer together. The platforms at the
d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts were full of people who wore a less provincial
look; the houses grew larger and so did
the towns; they found themselves flashing past
advertisements of all sorts of things, and especially
of things connected with the Fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how we used to play &lsquo;hunt the
thimble,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;and how, when any one
came near the place where it was hidden, we said,
&lsquo;Warm&mdash;warmer&mdash;warmer still&mdash;hot!&rsquo; It&rsquo;s like
that now. We have been getting warmer and
warmer every minute, and now we are getting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be in in a minute,&rdquo; said a big man at
the end of the car, and he stood up and began to
take down his things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot,&rdquo; said Robin, with an excited little laugh.
&ldquo;Meg, we&rsquo;re not going&mdash;going&mdash;going any more.
Look out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are steaming into the big d&eacute;p&ocirc;t,&rdquo; cried
Meg. &ldquo;How big it is! What crowds of people!
Robin, we are there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin bent down to pick up their satchel; the
people all rose in their seats and began to move
in a mass down the aisle toward the door.
Everybody seemed suddenly to become eager
and in a hurry, as if they thought the train would
begin to move again and carry them away.
Some were expecting friends to meet them, some
were anxious about finding accommodations.
Those who knew each other talked, asked questions
over people&rsquo;s shoulders, and there was a
general anxiety about valises, parcels, and umbrellas.
Robin and Meg were pressed back into
their section by the crowd, against which they
were too young to make headway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to wait until the grown-up
people have passed by,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<p>But the crowd in the aisle soon lost its compactness,
and they were able to get out. The
porter, who stood on the platform near the steps,
looked at them curiously, and glanced behind
them to see who was with them, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>It seemed to the two as if all the world must
have poured itself into the big d&eacute;p&ocirc;t or be passing
through it. People were rushing about;
friends were searching for one another, pushing
their way through the surging crowd; some
were greeting each other with exclamations and
hand-shaking, and stopping up the way; there
was a Babel of voices, a clamor of shouts within
the covered place, and from outside came a roar
of sound rising from the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>For a few moments Robin and Meg were overwhelmed.
They did not quite know what to do;
everybody pushed past and jostled them. No
one was ill-natured, but no one had time to be polite.
They were so young and so strange to all
such worlds of excitement and rush, involuntarily
they clutched each other&rsquo;s hands after their time-honored
fashion, when they were near each other
and overpowered. The human vortex caught
them up and carried them along, not knowing
where they were going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem so little!&rdquo; gasped Meg. &ldquo;There&mdash;there
are so many people! Rob, Rob, where are
we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin had lost his breath too. Suddenly the
world seemed so huge&mdash;so huge! Just for a moment
he felt himself turn pale, and he looked at
Meg and saw that she was pale too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody is going out of the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on to me tight, Meg. It will be all
right. We shall get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they did. The crowd surged and
swayed and struggled, and before long they saw
that it was surging towards the entrance gate, and
it took them with it. Just as they thrust through
they found themselves pushed against a man,
who good-naturedly drew a little back to save
Meg from striking against his valise, which was a
very substantial one. She looked up to thank
him, and gave a little start. It was the man she
had called &ldquo;our man&rdquo; the night before, when she
spoke of him to Robin. And he gave them a
sharp but friendly nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you two again.
You <i>are</i> going to the Fair!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Robin looked up at his shrewd face with a civil
little grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; we are,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy it,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Big
thing.&rdquo; And he was pushed past them and soon
lost in the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">X</span></h2>
<p>The crowd in the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t surged into the streets,
and melted into and became an addition to the
world of people there. The pavements were
moving masses of human beings, the centres of
the streets were pandemoniums of wagons and
vans, street cars, hotel omnibuses, and carriages.
The brilliant morning sunlight dazzled the children&rsquo;s
eyes; the roar of wheels and the clamor of
car bells, of clattering horses&rsquo; feet, of cries and
shouts and passing voices, mingled in a volume
of sound that deafened them. The great tidal
wave of human life and work and pleasure almost
took them off their feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>They knew too little of cities to have had beforehand
any idea of what the overwhelming
rush and roar would be, and what slight straws
they would feel themselves upon the current. If
they had been quite ordinary children, they might
well have been frightened. But they were not
ordinary children, little as they were aware of
that important factor in their young lives. They
were awed for this first moment, but, somehow,
they were fascinated as much as they were awed,
while they stood for a brief breathing-space looking
on. They did not know&mdash;no child of their
ages can possibly know such things of him or
herself&mdash;that Nature had made them of the metal
out of which she moulds strong things and great
ones. As they had not comprehended the restless
sense of wrong and misery the careless, unlearning,
and ungrowing life in Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s
world filled them with, so they did not understand
that, because they had been born creatures
who belong to the great moving, working, venturing
world, they were not afraid of it, and felt
their first young face-to-face encounter with it a
thing which thrilled them with an exultant emotion
they could not have explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world,&rdquo; said Rob.
&ldquo;It&mdash;I believe it is ours, Meg. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg was staring with entranced eyes at the
passing multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;More pilgrims are come to town,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said,
quoting the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; with a far-off
look in her intense little black-browed face. &ldquo;You
remember what it said, Rob, &lsquo;Here also all the
noise of them that walked in the streets was,
More pilgrims are come to town.&rsquo; Oh, isn&rsquo;t it like
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>It was. And the exaltation and thrill of it got
into their young blood and made them feel as if
they walked on air, and that every passing human
thing meant, somehow, life and strength to
them.</p>
<p>Their appetites were sharpened by the morning
air, and they consulted as to what their breakfast
should be. They had no money to spend at restaurants,
and every penny must be weighed and
calculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk on,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;until we see a
bakery that looks as if it was kept by poor people.
Then we can buy some bread, and eat it with our
eggs somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>They marched boldly on. The crowd jostled
them, and there was so much noise that they
could hardly hear each other speak; but ah! how
the sun shone, and how the pennons fluttered and
streamed on every side, and how excited and full
of living the people&rsquo;s faces looked! It seemed
splendid, only to be alive in such a world on such
a morning. The sense of the practical which had
suggested that they should go to a small place led
them into the side streets. They passed all the
big shops without a glance, but at last Meg
stooped before a small one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman in there,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I just
saw her for a minute. She has a nice face. She
looked as if she might be good-natured. Let&rsquo;s go
in there, Robin. It&rsquo;s quite a small place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>They went in. It was a small place but a
clean one, and the woman had a good-natured
face. She was a German, and was broad and
placid and comfortable. They bought some fresh
rolls from her, and as she served them, and was
making the change, Meg watched her anxiously.
She was thinking that she did look very peaceable,
indeed. So, instead of turning away from
the counter, she planted herself directly before
her and asked her a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have some hard-boiled
eggs to eat with our bread, and we are not
going home. If we are very careful, would you
mind if we ate our breakfast in here, instead of
outside? We won&rsquo;t let any of the crumbs or
shells drop on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not going home?&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;You from out town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like you wass goun to der Fair,&rdquo; said
the woman, with a good-tempered smile. &ldquo;Who
wass with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;We are going alone.
But we&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My crayshious!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;But you
wass young for that. But your &rsquo;Merican childrens
is queer ones. Yes! You can sit down an&rsquo; eat
your bregfast. That make no matter to me if you
is careful. You can sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>There were two chairs near a little table, where,
perhaps, occasional customers ate buns, and they
sat down to their rolls and eggs and salt, as to a
feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hungry,&rdquo; said Rob, cracking his fourth
egg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I!&rdquo; said Meg, feeling that her fresh
roll was very delicious.</p>
<p>It was a delightful breakfast. The German
woman watched them with placid curiosity as
they ate it. She had been a peasant in her own
country, and had lived in a village among rosy,
stout, and bucolic little Peters and Gretchens,
who were not given to enterprise, and the American
child was a revelation to her. And somehow,
also, these two had an attraction all American
children had not. They looked so well able to
take care of themselves, and yet had such good
manners and no air of self-importance at all.
They ate their rolls and hard-boiled eggs with all
the gusto of very young appetite, but they evidently
meant to keep their part of the bargain, and
leave her no crumbs and shells to sweep up. The
truth was that they were perfectly honorable little
souls, and had a sense of justice. They were in
the midst of their breakfast, when they were
rather startled by hearing her voice from the end
of the counter where she had been standing, leaning
against the wall, her arms folded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like a cup coffee?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/img007.jpg" alt="&ldquo;YOU LIKE A CUP COFFEE?&rdquo; SHE ASKED." width="600" height="771" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;YOU LIKE A CUP COFFEE?&rdquo; SHE ASKED.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>They both looked round, uncertain what to say,
not knowing whether or not that she meant that
she sold coffee. They exchanged rather disturbed
glances, and then Robin answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford it, thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got so little money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she astonished them by answering,
&ldquo;that cost me nothing. There some coffee left
on the back of the stove from my man&rsquo;s bregfast.
I give you each a cup.&rdquo; And she actually went
into the little back room, and presently brought
back two good cups of hot coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you drink that,&rdquo; she said, setting them
down on the little table. &ldquo;If you children goun
to der Fair in that crowd by yourselves, you want
something in your stomachs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so good&mdash;it was so unexpected&mdash;it seemed
such luck! They looked at each other with beaming
eyes, and at her with quite disproportionate
gratitude. It was much more than two cups of
coffee to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; they both exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
so much obliged to you, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their feast seemed to become quite a royal
thing. They never had felt so splendidly fed in
their lives. It seemed as if they had never
tasted such coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>When the meal was finished, they rose refreshed
enough to feel ready for anything. They went
up to the counter and thanked the German woman
again. It was Meg who spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to say thank you again,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We are very much obliged to you for letting us
eat our breakfast in here. It was so nice to sit
down, and the coffee was so splendid. I dare say
we do seem rather young to be by ourselves, but
that makes us all the more thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I hope
you don&rsquo;t get lost by der Fair&mdash;and have good
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they went forth on their pilgrimage,
into the glorious morning, into the rushing world
that seemed so splendid and so gay&mdash;into the
fairy-land that only themselves and those like
them could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice when some one&rsquo;s kind to you,
Rob?&rdquo; Meg exclaimed joyfully, when they got
into the sunshine. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you feel
happy, somehow, not because they&rsquo;ve done something,
but just because they&rsquo;ve been kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; answered Rob, stepping out
bravely. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you what I believe&mdash;I believe
there are a lot of kind people in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;re in it
even when we don&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the more, with springing steps and
brave young faces, they walked on their way to
fairy-land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>They had talked it all over&mdash;how they would
enter their City Beautiful. It would be no light
thing to them, their entrance into it. They were
innocently epicurean about it, and wanted to see
it at the very first in all its loveliness. They knew
that there were gates of entrance here and there,
through which thousands poured each day; but
Meg had a fancy of her own, founded, of course,
upon that other progress of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;oh, we must go in by the
water, just like those other pilgrims who came to
town. You know that part at the last where it
says, &lsquo;And so many went over the water and were
let in at the golden gates to-day.&rsquo; Let us go over
the water and be let in at the golden gates. But
the water we shall go over won&rsquo;t be dark and bitter;
it will be blue and splendid, and the sun will
be shining everywhere. Ah, Rob, how <i>can</i> it be
true that we are here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>They knew all about the great arch of entrance
and stately peristyle. They had read in the newspapers
all about its height and the height of the
statues adorning it; they knew how many columns
formed the peristyle, but it was not height
or breadth or depth or width they remembered.
The picture which remained with them and
haunted them like a fair dream was of a white
and splendid archway, crowned with one of the
great stories of the world in marble&mdash;the triumph
of the man in whom the god was so strong that
his dreams, the working of his mind, his strength,
his courage, his suffering, wrested from the silence
of the Unknown a new and splendid world. It
was this great white arch they always thought
of, with this precious marble story crowning it,
the blue, blue water spread before the stately columns
at its side, and the City Beautiful within the
courts it guarded. And it was to this they were
going when they found their way to the boat
which would take them to it.</p>
<p>It was such a heavenly day of June! The
water was so amethystine, the sky such a vault
of rapture! What did it matter to them that they
were jostled and crowded, and counted for nothing
among those about them? What did it matter
that there were often near them common faces,
speaking of nothing but common, stupid pleasure
or common sharpness and greed? What did it
matter that scarcely any one saw what they saw,
or, seeing it, realized its splendid, hopeful meaning?
Little recked they of anything but the entrancement
of blue sky and water, and the City
Beautiful they were drawing near to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>When first out of the blueness there rose the
fair shadow of the whiteness, they sprang from their
seats, and, hand in hand, made their way to the
side, and there stood watching, as silent as if they
did not dare to speak lest it should melt away;
and from a fair white spirit it grew to a real thing&mdash;more
white, more fair, more stately, and more
an enchanted thing than even they had believed
or hoped.</p>
<p>And the crowd surged about them, and women
exclaimed and men talked, and there was a rushing
to and fro, and the ringing of a bell, and
movement and action and excitement were on
every side. But somehow these two children
stood hand in hand and only looked.</p>
<p>And their dream had come true, though it had
been a child&rsquo;s dream of an enchanted thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">XI</span></h2>
<p>They passed beneath the snow-white stateliness
of the great arch, still hand in hand, and silent.
They walked softly, almost as if they felt themselves
treading upon holy ground. To their
youth and unworn souls it <i>was</i> like holy ground,
they had so dreamed of it, they had so longed
for it, it had been so mingled in their minds with
the story of a city not of this world.</p>
<p>And they stood within the court beyond the
archway, the fair and noble colonnade, its sweep
of columns, statue-crowned, behind them, the
wonder of the City Beautiful spread before. The
water of blue lagoons lapped the bases of white
palaces, as if with a caress of homage to their
beauty. On every side these marvels stood; everywhere
there was the green of sward and
broad-leaved plants, the sapphire of water, the
flood of color and human life passing by, and
above it all and enclosing it, the warm, deep,
splendid blueness of the summer sky.</p>
<p>It was so white&mdash;it was so full of the marvel of
color&mdash;it was so strange&mdash;it was so radiant and
unearthly in its beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The two children only stood still and gazed
and gazed, with widening eyes and parted lips.
They could not have moved about at first; they
only stood and lost themselves as in a dream.</p>
<p>Meg was still for so long that Robin, turning
slowly to look at her at last, was rather awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Meg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, in a voice only half awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg! Meg! We are <i>there</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;Only it is so like&mdash;that
other City&mdash;that it seems as if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She gave a
queer little laugh, and turned to look at him.
&ldquo;Rob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;perhaps we are <i>dead</i>, and have
just wakened up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That brought them back to earth. They
laughed together. No, they were not dead.
They were breathless and uplifted by an ecstasy,
but they had never been so fully <i>alive</i> before.
It seemed as if they were in the centre
of the world, and the world was such a bright
and radiant and beautiful place as they had never
dreamed of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we go first?&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;What
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>But it was so difficult to decide that. It did
not seem possible to make a plan and follow it.
It was not possible for them, at least. They were
too happy and too young. Surely visitors to
fairy-land could not make plans! They gave
themselves up to the spell, and went where fancy
led them. And it led them far, and through
strange beauties, which seemed like dreams come
true. They wandered down broad pathways, past
green sward, waving palms, glowing masses of
flowers, white balustrades bordering lagoons
lightly ruffled by a moment&rsquo;s wind. Wonderful
statues stood on silent guard, sometimes in
groups, sometimes majestic colossal figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look as if they were all watching the
thousands and thousands go by,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if they must be thinking something
about it all,&rdquo; Meg answered. &ldquo;It could
not be that they could stand there and look like
that and not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was she who soon after built up for them
the only scheme they made during those enchanted
days. It could scarcely be called a plan
of action, it was so much an outcome of imagination
and part of a vision, but it was a great
joy to them through every hour of their pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Standing upon a fairy bridge, looking over
shining canals crossed by these fairy bridges
again and again, the gold sun lighting snow-white
columns, archways, towers, and minarets,
statues and rushing fountains, flowers and palms,
her child eyes filled with a deep, strange glow of
joy and dreaming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>She leaned upon the balustrade in her favorite
fashion, her chin upon her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need not <i>pretend</i> it is a fairy story,
Robin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> a fairy story, but it
is real. Who ever thought a fairy story could
come true? I&rsquo;ve made up how it came to be like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us how,&rdquo; said Robin, looking over the
jewelled water almost as she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was a
great Magician who was the ruler of all the Genii
in all the world. They were all powerful and
rich and wonderful magicians, but he could make
them obey him, and give him what they stored
away. And he said: &lsquo;I will build a splendid City,
that all the world shall flock to and wonder at
and remember forever. And in it some of all
the things in the world shall be seen, so that the
people who see it shall learn what the world is
like&mdash;how huge it is, and what wisdom it has in
it, and what wonders! And it will make them
know what <i>they</i> are like themselves, because the
wonders will be made by hands and feet and
brains just like their own. And so they will
understand how strong they are&mdash;if they only
knew it&mdash;and it will give them courage and fill
them with thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped a moment, and Rob pushed her
gently with his elbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I like it. It sounds quite
true. What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he called all the Genii together and
called them by their names. There was one who
was the king of all the pictures and statues, and
the people who worked at making them. They
did not know they had a Genius, but they had,
and he put visions into their heads, and made
them feel restless until they had worked them
out into statues and paintings. And the Great
Genius said to him: &lsquo;You must build a palace
for <i>your</i> people, and make them pour their finest
work into it; and all the people who are made
to be your workers, whether they know it or not,
will look at your palace and see what other ones
have done, and wonder if they cannot do it themselves.&rsquo;
And there was a huge, huge Genius who
was made of steel and iron and gold and silver
and wheels, and the Magician said to him: &lsquo;Build
a great palace, and make your workers fill it with
all the machines and marvels they have made, and
all who see will know what wonders can be done,
and feel that there is no wonder that isn&rsquo;t done
that is too great for human beings to plan.&rsquo; And
there was a Genius of the strange countries, and
one who knew all the plants and flowers and trees
that grew, and one who lived at the bottom of
the sea and knew the fishes by name and strode
about among them. And each one was commanded
to build a palace or to make his people
work, and they grew so interested that in the end
each one wanted his palace and his people to be
the most wonderful of all. And so the City was
built, and we are in it, Robin, though we are only
twelve years old, and nobody cares about us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;and the City is as much
ours as if we were the Magician himself. Meg,
who was the Magician? <i>What</i> was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;Nobody knows.
He is that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She gave a sudden, queer
little touch to her forehead and one to her side.
&ldquo;<i>That</i>, you know, Rob! The thing that <i>thinks</i>&mdash;and
makes us want to do things and be things.
Don&rsquo;t you suppose so, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that made us want so to come here
that we could not bear <i>not</i> to come?&rdquo; said Robin.
&ldquo;The thing that makes you make up stories about
everything, and always have queer thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that!&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;And every one has
some of it; and there are such millions of people,
and so there is enough to make the Great Magician.
Robin, come along; let us go to the palace
the picture Genius built, and see what his people
put in it. Let us be part of the fairy story when
we go anywhere. It will make it beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>They took their fairy story with them and went
their way. They made it as much the way of a
fairy story as possible. They found a gondola
with a rich-hued, gay-scarfed gondolier, and took
their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are in Venice,&rdquo; Meg said, as they
shot smoothly out upon the lagoon. &ldquo;We can
be in any country we like. Now we are in
Venice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their gondola stopped, and lay rocking on the
lagoon before the palace&rsquo;s broad white steps.
They mounted them, and entered into a rich,
glowing world, all unknown.</p>
<p>They knew little of pictures, they knew nothing
of statuary, but they went from room to
room, throbbing with enjoyment. They stopped
before beautiful faces and happy scenes, and
vaguely smiled, though they did not know they
were smiling; they lingered before faces and
figures that were sad, and their own dark little
faces grew soft and grave. They could not afford
to buy a catalogue, so they could only look and
pity and delight or wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make up the stories and thoughts
of them ourselves,&rdquo; Robin said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it
in turns, Meg. Yours will be the best ones, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/img008.jpg" alt="&ldquo;NOW WE ARE IN VENICE.&rdquo;" width="600" height="779" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;NOW WE ARE IN VENICE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>And this was what they did. As they passed
from picture to picture, each took turns at building
up explanations. Some of them might have
been at once surprising and instructive to the
artist concerned, but some were very vivid, and
all were full of young directness and clear sight,
and the fresh imagining and coloring of the unworn
mind. They were so interested that it became
like a sort of exciting game. They forgot
all about the people around them; they did not
know that their two small, unchaperoned figures
attracted more glances than one. They were so
accustomed to being alone, that they never exactly
counted themselves in with other people.
And now, it was as if they were at a banquet,
feasting upon strange viands, and the new flavors
were like wine to them. They went from side
to side of the rooms, drawn sometimes by a glow
of color, sometimes by a hinted story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anything about pictures, I
suppose,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;but we can see everything
is in them. There are the poor, working in the
fields and the mills, being glad or sorry; and
there are the rich ones, dancing at balls and standing
in splendid places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are the good ones and the bad
ones. You can see it in their faces,&rdquo; Rob went
on, for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;richness and poorness and
goodness and badness and happiness and gladness.
The Genius who made this palace was a
very proud one, and he said he would put all the
world in it, even if his workers could only make
pictures and statues.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was he the strongest of all?&rdquo; asked Robin,
taking up the story again with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Meg answered; &ldquo;sometimes
I think he was. He was strong&mdash;he was very
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been too deeply plunged into their
mood to notice a man who stood near them, looking
at a large picture. In fact, the man himself
had not at first noticed them, but when Meg
began to speak her voice attracted him. He
turned his head, and looked at her odd little reflecting
face, and, after having looked at it, he
stood listening to her. An expression of recognition
came into his strong, clean-shaven face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two again!&rdquo; he said, when she had finished.
&ldquo;And you have got here.&rdquo; It was their
man again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Meg, her gray eyes revealing,
as she lifted them to his face, that she came back
to earth with some difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like it, as far as you&rsquo;ve gone?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are making believe that it is a fairy story,&rdquo;
Meg answered; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s very easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then a group of people came between and
separated them.</p>

<p>How tired they were when they came out from
the world of pictures into the world of thronging
people! How their limbs ached and they were
brought back to the realization that they were
creatures with human bodies, which somehow
they seemed to have forgotten!</p>
<p>When they stood in the sunshine again Robin
drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like coming out of one dream into another,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We must have been there a
long time. I didn&rsquo;t know I was tired and I didn&rsquo;t
know I was hungry, but I am both. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was as tired and hungry as he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare we buy a sandwich to eat with our
eggs?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think we dare,&rdquo; Robin answered.
&ldquo;Where shall we go and eat them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>There was no difficulty in deciding. She had
planned it all out, and they so knew the place by
heart that they did not need to ask their way. It
was over one of the fairy bridges which led to a
fairy island. It was softly wooded, and among
the trees were winding paths and flowers and
rustic seats, and quaint roofs peering above the
greenness of branches. And it was full of the
warm scent of roses, growing together in sumptuous
thousands, their heavy, sweet heads uplifted
to the sun, or nodding and leaning towards their
neighbors&rsquo; clusters.</p>
<p>The fairy bridge linked it to the wonderful
world beyond, but by comparison its bowers were
almost quiet. The crowd did not jostle there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall be eating our lunch near thousands
and thousands of roses. It will be like
the &lsquo;Arabian Nights.&rsquo; Let us pretend that the
rose who is queen of them all invited us, because
we belong to nobody,&rdquo; Meg said.</p>
<p>They bought the modest addition to their meal,
and carried the necessary, ever-present satchel to
their bower. They were tired of dragging the
satchel about, but they were afraid to lose sight
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very well that it is such a small one, and
that we have so little in it,&rdquo; Robin said. They
chose the most secluded corner they could find,
as near to the rose garden as possible, and sat
down and fell upon their scant lunch as they had
fallen upon their breakfast.</p>
<p>It was very scant for two ravenously hungry
children, and they tried to make it last as long as
possible. But scant as it was, and tired as they
were, their spirits did not fail them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if we eat it slowly, it will seem
more,&rdquo; said Meg, peeling an egg with deliberation,
but with a very undeliberate feeling in her
small stomach. &ldquo;Robin, did you notice our
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him, of course,&rdquo; answered Robin; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
too big not to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>noticed</i> him,&rdquo; continued Meg. &ldquo;Robin,
there&rsquo;s something the matter with that man.
He&rsquo;s a gloomy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you noticed him quickly,&rdquo; Robin responded,
with a shade of fraternal incredulity.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s eyes fixed themselves on a glimpse of
blue water she saw through the trees. She
looked as if she were thinking the matter over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.
But, somehow, he has a dreary face, as if he had
been thinking of dreary things. I don&rsquo;t know
why I thought that all in a minute, but I did, and
I believe it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we should see him again,&rdquo; Robin said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we shall see him again,&rdquo; said Meg.
&ldquo;How many eggs have we left, Robin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only brought three dozen,&rdquo; he answered,
looking into the satchel; &ldquo;and we ate seven this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you have nothing but eggs, you eat a
good many,&rdquo; said Meg, reflectively. &ldquo;They
won&rsquo;t last very long. But we couldn&rsquo;t have
carried a thousand eggs, even if we had had
them&rdquo;&mdash;which was a sage remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to buy some cheap things,&rdquo;
was Robin&rsquo;s calculation. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to be
very cheap, though. We have to pay a dollar,
you know, every day, to come in; and if we have
no money we can&rsquo;t go into the places that are not
free; and we want to go into everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go in hungry than stay outside and
have real dinners, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Meg put it to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s pretty
hard to be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had chosen a secluded corner to sit in,
but it was not so secluded that they had it entirely
to themselves. At a short distance from them, in
the nearest bowery nook, a young man and woman
were eating something out of a basket. They
looked like a young country pair, plain and awkward,
and enjoying themselves immensely. Their
clothes were common and their faces were tanned,
as if from working out of doors. But their basket
evidently contained good, home-made things to
eat. Meg caught glimpses of ham and chicken,
and something that looked like cake. Just at that
moment they looked so desperately good that she
turned away her eyes, because she did not want
to stare at them rudely. And as she averted
them, she saw that Robin had seen, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those people have plenty to eat,&rdquo; he said, with
a short, awkward laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us look. We
are <i>here</i>, Robin, anyway, and we knew we couldn&rsquo;t
come as other people do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are <i>here</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man and his wife finished their lunch, and
began putting things in order in their basket. As
they did it, they talked together in a low voice,
and seemed to be discussing something. Somehow,
in spite of her averted eyes, Meg suddenly
felt as if they were discussing Robin and herself,
and she wondered if they had caught her involuntary
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Robin,&rdquo; said Meg&mdash;&ldquo;I think that
woman is going to speak to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that she was. She got up and
came towards them, her husband following her
rather awkwardly.</p>
<p>She stopped before them, and the two pairs of
dark eyes lifted themselves to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been talking to my man about you
two,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help looking at
you. Have you lost your friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t got any;
I mean, we&rsquo;re not with any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman turned and looked at her husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jem!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The man drew near and looked them over.</p>
<p>He was a raw-boned, big young man, with a
countrified, good-natured face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t come here alone?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have come,
if we hadn&rsquo;t come alone. We&rsquo;re not afraid, thank
you. We&rsquo;re getting along very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jem!&rdquo; said the woman again.</p>
<p>She seemed quite stirred. There was something
in her ordinary, good-natured face that was
quite like a sort of rough emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you plenty of money?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;not plenty, but we have a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her basket down and opened it. She
took out some pieces of brown fried chicken; then
she took out some big slices of cake, with raisins
in it. She even added some biscuits and slices of
ham. Then she put them in a coarse, clean napkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go filling
up with candy and peanuts, just because you
are by yourselves. You put this in your bag, and
eat it when you&rsquo;re ready. &rsquo;T any rate, it&rsquo;s good,
home-made victuals, and won&rsquo;t harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the midst of their shy thanks, she shut the
basket again and went off with her husband, and
they heard her say again, before she disappeared,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jem!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic8">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;WELL, JEM!&rdquo; SHE EXCLAIMED.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">XIII</span></h2>
<p>Yes, there were plenty of kind people in the
world, and one of the best proofs of it was that,
in that busy, wonderful place through which all
the world seemed passing, and where, on every
side, were a thousand things to attract attention,
and so fill eyes and mind that forgetfulness and
carelessness of small things might not have been
quite unnatural, these two small things, utterly
insignificant and unknown to the crowds they
threaded, met many a passing friend of the moment,
and found themselves made happier by
many a kindly and helpful word or look. Officials
were good-natured to them, guides were
good-humored, motherly women and fatherly men
protected them in awkward crowds. They always
saw that those who noticed them glanced
about for their chaperons, and again and again
they were asked who was taking care of them;
but Robin&rsquo;s straightforward, civil little answer,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking care of ourselves,&rdquo; never failed to
waken as much friendly interest as surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>They kept up their fairy story of the Great
Genius, and called things by fairy-story names,
and talked to each other of their fairy-story fancies
about them. It was so much more delightful
to say: &ldquo;Let us go to the Palace of the Genius of
the Sea,&rdquo; than to say, &ldquo;Let us go to the Fisheries&rsquo;
building.&rdquo; And once in the palace, standing
among great rocks and pools and fountains, with
water splashing and tumbling over strange sea-plants,
and strange sea-monsters swimming beneath
their eyes in green sea-water, it was easy to
believe in the Genius who had brought them all
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very huge,&rdquo; Meg said, making a picture
of him. &ldquo;He had monstrous eyes, that
looked like the sea when it is blue; he had great,
white coral teeth, and he had silver, scaly fishskin
wound round him, and his hair was long sea-grass
and green and brown weeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood in grottoes and looked down into
clear pools, at swift-darting things of gold and
silver and strange prismatic colors. Meg made
up stories of tropical rivers, with palms and jungle
cane fringing them, and tigers and lions coming
to lap at the brink. She invented rushing mountain
streams and lakes, with speckled trout leaping;
and deep, deep seas, where whales lay rocking
far below, and porpoises rolled, and devil-fish
spread hideous, far-reaching tentacles for prey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Oh, what a day it was! What wonders they
saw and hung over, and dwelt on with passions
of young delight! The great sea gave up its
deep to them; great forests and trackless jungles
their wonderful growths; kings&rsquo; palaces and
queens&rsquo; coffers their rarest treasures; the ages of
long ago their relics and strange legends, in stone
and wood and brass and gold.</p>
<p>They did not know how often people turned
and stopped to look at their two little, close-leaning
figures and vivid, dark, ecstatic-eyed faces.
They certainly never chanced to see that one
figure was often behind them at a safe distance,
and seemed rather to have fallen into the habit of
going where they went and listening to what they
said. It was their man, curiously enough, and it
was true that he was rather a gloomy-looking
man, when one observed him well. His keen,
business-like, well-cut face had a cloud resting
upon it; he looked listless and unsmiling, even in
the palaces that most stirred the children&rsquo;s souls;
and, in fact, it seemed to be their odd enthusiasm
which had attracted him a little, because he was
in the mood to feel none himself. He had been
within hearing distance when Meg had been telling
her stories of the Genius of the Palace of the
Sea, and a faint smile had played about his mouth
for a moment. Then he had drawn a trifle nearer,
still keeping out of sight, and when they had
moved he had followed them. He had been a
hard, ambitious, wealth-gaining man all his life.
A few years before he had found a new happiness,
which softened him for a while, and made
his world seem a brighter thing. Then a black
sorrow had come upon him, and everything had
changed. He had come to the Enchanted City,
not as the children had come, because it shone before
them, a radiant joy, but because he wondered
if it would distract him at all. All other things
had failed; his old habits of work and scheme,
his successes, his ever-growing fortune, they were
all as nothing. The world was empty to him,
and he walked about it feeling like a ghost. The
little dark, vivid faces had attracted him, he did
not know why, and when he heard the story of
the Palace of the Sea, he was led on by a vague
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>He was near them often during the day, but it
was not until late in the afternoon that they saw
him themselves, when he did not see them. They
came upon him in a quiet spot where he was
sitting alone. On a seat near him sat a young
woman, resting, with a baby asleep in her arms.
The young woman was absorbed in her child, and
was apparently unconscious of him. His arms
were folded and his head bent, but he was looking
at her in an absent, miserable way. It was as
if she made him think of something bitter and
sad.</p>
<p>Meg and Robin passed him quietly.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/img010.jpg" alt="HE WAS LOOKING AT HER IN AN ABSENT, MISERABLE WAY." width="600" height="779" />
<p class="caption">HE WAS LOOKING AT HER IN AN ABSENT, MISERABLE WAY.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you meant, Meg,&rdquo; Robin said.
&ldquo;He does look as if something was the matter
with him. I wonder what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they passed out of the gates at dusk, it
was with worn-out bodies, but enraptured souls.
In the street-car, which they indulged in the extravagance
of taking, the tired people, sitting exhaustedly
in the seats and hanging on to straps,
looked with a sort of wonder at them, their faces
shone so like stars. They did not know where
they were going to sleep, and they were more
than ready for lying down, but they were happy
beyond words.</p>
<p>They went with the car until it reached the
city&rsquo;s heart, and then they got out and walked.
The streets were lighted, and the thoroughfares
were a riot of life and sound. People were going
to theatres, restaurants, and hotels, which were
a blaze of electric radiance. They found themselves
limping a little, but they kept stoutly on,
holding firmly to the satchel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t be afraid of going anywhere, however
poor it looks,&rdquo; Robin said, with a grave little
elderly air. He was curiously grave for his
years, sometimes. &ldquo;Anybody can see we have
nothing to steal. I think any one would know that
we only want to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>It was a queer place they finally hit upon. It
was up a side street, which was poorly lighted,
and where the houses were all shabby and small.
On the steps of one of them a tired-looking woman
was sitting, with a pale, old-faced boy beside
her. Robin stopped before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a room where my sister could
sleep, and I could have a mattress on the floor, or
lie down on anything?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford
to go anywhere where it will cost more than
fifty cents each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked at them indifferently. She
was evidently very much worn out with her day&rsquo;s
work, and discouraged by things generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything worth more than fifty
cents, goodness knows,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You
must be short of money to come here. I&rsquo;ve never
thought of having roomers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;and we know we
can&rsquo;t have anything but a poor room. If we can
lie down, we are so tired we shall go to sleep
anywhere. We&rsquo;ve been at the Fair all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pale little old-faced boy leaned forward,
resting his arm on his mother&rsquo;s knee. They saw
that he was a very poor little fellow, indeed, with
a hunch back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let &rsquo;em stay; I&rsquo;ll sleep on
the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The woman gave a dreary half laugh, and got
up from the step. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy about the Fair,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;We hain&rsquo;t no money to spend on
Fairs, and he&rsquo;s most wild about it. You can stay
here to-night, if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a sign to them to follow her. The
hunchback boy rose too, and went into the dark
passage after them. He seemed to regard them
with a kind of hunger in his look.</p>
<p>They went up the narrow, steep staircase. It
was only lighted by a dim gleam from a room
below, whose door was open. The balustrades
were rickety, and some of them were broken out.
It was a forlorn enough place. The hunchback
boy came up the steps, awkwardly, behind them.
It was as if he wanted to see what would happen.</p>
<p>They went up two flights of the crooked, crazy
stairs, and at the top of the second flight the
woman opened a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the place there is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t anything more than a place to lie down in,
you see. I can put a mattress on the floor for
you, and your sister can sleep in the cot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we want,&rdquo; replied Robin.</p>
<p>But it was a poor place. A room, both small
and bare, and with broken windows. There was
nothing in it but the cot and a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben sleeps here,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;If I
couldn&rsquo;t make him a place on the floor, near me,
I couldn&rsquo;t let it to you.&rdquo; Meg turned and looked
at Ben. He was gazing at her with a nervous
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re much obliged to you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, with eager shyness.
&ldquo;Do you want some water to wash yourselves
with? I can bring you up a tin basin and a jug.
You can set it on the chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; they both said at once. And
Robin added, &ldquo;We want washing pretty badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben turned about and went down-stairs for the
water as if he felt a sort of excitement in doing
the service. These two children, who looked as
poor as himself, set stirring strange thoughts in
his small, unnourished brain.</p>
<p>He brought back the tin basin and water, a
piece of yellow soap, and even a coarse, rather
dingy, towel. He had been so eager that he was
out of breath when he returned, but he put the
basin on the chair and the tin jug beside it, with
a sort of exultant look in his poor face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Meg again; &ldquo;thank you,
Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not help watching him as his mother
prepared the rather wretched mattress for Robin.
Once he caught the look of her big, childish,
gray eyes as it rested upon him with questioning
sympathy, and he flushed up so that even by the
light of the little smoky lamp she saw it. When
the woman had finished she and the boy went
away and left them, and they stood a moment
looking at each other. They were both thinking
of the same thing, but somehow they did not put
it into words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wash off the dust first,&rdquo; said Robin,
&ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll eat some of the things we have
left from what the woman gave us. And then
we&rsquo;ll go to bed, and we shall drop just like logs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this they did, and it was certainly a very
short time before the smoky little lamp was out,
and each had dropped like a log and lay stretched
in the darkness, with a sense of actual ecstasy in
limbs laid down to rest and muscles relaxed for
sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; said Meg, drowsily, through the dark
that divided them, &ldquo;everybody in the world has
something to give to somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that, too,&rdquo; Robin answered, just
as sleepily; &ldquo;nobody is so poor&mdash;that&mdash;he&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
anything. That&mdash;boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He let us have his hard bed,&rdquo; Meg murmured,
&ldquo;and he&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t seen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her voice died away, and Robin would not
have heard her if she had said more. And they
were both fast, fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">XIV</span></h2>
<p>It would have been a loud sound which would
have awakened them during those deep sleeping
hours of the night. They did not even stir on
their poor pillows when, long after midnight,
there was the noise of heavy drunken footsteps
and heavy drunken stumbling in the passage below,
and then the raising of a man&rsquo;s rough voice,
and the upsetting of chairs and the slamming of
doors, mingled with the expostulations of the
woman, whose husband had come home in something
worse than his frequent ill-fashion. They
slept sweetly through it all, but when the morning
came, and hours of unbroken rest had made their
slumbers lighter, and the sunshine streamed in
through the broken windows, they were called
back to the world by loud and angry sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Meg, sitting bolt upright
and rubbing her eyes; &ldquo;somebody&rsquo;s shouting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And somebody&rsquo;s crying,&rdquo; said Robin, sitting
up too, but more slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>It was quite clear to them, as soon as they were
fully awake, that both these things were happening.
A man seemed to be quarrelling below.
They could hear him stamping about and swearing
savagely. And they could hear the woman&rsquo;s
voice, which sounded as if she were trying to
persuade him to do or leave undone something.
They could not hear her words, but she was crying,
and somebody else was crying, too, and they
knew it was the boy with the little old face and
the hump-back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the woman&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; said
Meg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he wasn&rsquo;t here last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he knows we are here,&rdquo; said
Robin, listening anxiously.</p>
<p>It was plain that he did know. They heard
him stumbling up the staircase, grumbling and
swearing as he came, and he was coming up to
their room, it was evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; exclaimed Meg, in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Robin answered, breathlessly. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heavy feet blundered up the short second
flight and blundered to their door. It seemed
that the man had not slept off his drunken fit.
He struck the door with his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand out that dollar,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;When
my wife takes roomers I&rsquo;m going to be paid.
Hand it out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>They heard the woman hurrying up the stairs
after him. She was out of breath with crying,
and there was a choking sound in her voice when
she spoke to them through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better let him have it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said the man, roughly.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d&rsquo; they suppose owns the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin got up and took a dollar from their very
small store, which was hidden in the lining of his
trousers. He went to the door and opened it a
little, and held the money out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The man snatched it out of his hand and turned
away, and went stumbling down stairs, still growling.
The woman stood a minute on the landing,
and they heard her make a pitiful sort of sound,
half sob, half sniff.</p>
<p>Meg sat up in bed, with her chin on her hands,
and glared like a little lioness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of <i>that</i>?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a devil!&rdquo; said Robin, with terseness.
And he was conscious of no impropriety. &ldquo;I
wanted that boy to have it, and <i>go</i>.&rdquo; It was not
necessary to say where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; answered Meg. &ldquo;And I believe
his mother would have given it to him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>They heard the man leave the house a few minutes
later, and then it did not take them long to
dress and go down the narrow, broken-balustraded
stairs again. As they descended the first flight
they saw the woman cooking something over the
stove in her kitchen, and as she moved about they
saw her brush her apron across her eyes.</p>
<p>The squalid street was golden with the early
morning sunshine, which is such a joyful thing,
and, in the full, happy flood of it, a miserable little
figure sat crouched on the steps. It was the
boy Ben, and they saw that he looked paler than
he had looked the night before, and his little face
looked older. His elbow was on his knee and his
cheek on his hand, and there were wet marks on
his cheeks.</p>
<p>A large lump rose up in Meg&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; she whispered to
Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;so do I,&rdquo; Robin answered, rather unsteadily.
&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s poorer than anybody else. It
<i>ought</i> not to go by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;It oughtn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked straight to the threshold and sat
down on the step beside him. She was a
straightforward child, and she was too much
moved to stand on ceremony. She sat down
quite close by the poor little fellow, and put her
hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Never you
mind.&rdquo; And her throat felt so full that for a few
seconds she could say nothing more.</p>
<p>Robin stood against the door post. The effect
of this was to make his small jaw square itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind us at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&mdash;we
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little fellow looked at Meg and then up at
him. In that look he saw that they did know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother was going to give that dollar to me,&rdquo;
he said, brokenly. &ldquo;I was going to the Fair on
it. <i>Everybody</i> is going, everybody is talking
about it, and thinking about it! Nobody&rsquo;s been
talking of nothing else for months and months!
The streets are full of people on their way! And
they all pass me by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his sleeve across his forlorn face
and swallowed hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s pictures in the shops,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;and flags flying. And everything&rsquo;s going that
way, and me staying behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the large, splendid drops, which had
sometimes gathered on Meg&rsquo;s eyelashes and fallen
on the straw, when she had been telling stories in
the barn, fell now upon her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Robin stood and stared very straight before
him for a minute, and then his eyes turned and
met hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very poor,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;but <i>everybody</i>
has&mdash;has something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t leave him behind,&rdquo; Meg said,
&ldquo;we <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>! Let&rsquo;s think.&rdquo; And she put her
head down, resting her elbows on her knee and
clutching her forehead with her supple, strong
little hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do without?&rdquo; said Robin.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do without something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg lifted her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will eat nothing but the eggs for breakfast,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and go without lunch&mdash;if we can.
Perhaps we can&rsquo;t&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll try. And we will
not go into some of the places we have to pay to
go into. I will make up stories about them for
you. And, Robin, it <i>is</i> true&mdash;everybody has something
to give. That&rsquo;s what I have&mdash;the stories I
make up. It&rsquo;s <i>something</i>&mdash;just a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so little,&rdquo; Robin answered; &ldquo;it fills in
the empty place, Meg?&rdquo; with a question in his
voice.</p>
<p>She answered with a little nod, and then put
her hand on Ben&rsquo;s arm again. During their rapid
interchange of words he had been gazing at them
in a dazed, uncomprehending way. To his poor
little starved nature they seemed so strong and
different from himself that there was something
wonderful about them. Meg&rsquo;s glowing, dark
little face quite made his weak heart beat as she
turned it upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not much better off than you are,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but we think we&rsquo;ve got enough to take you
into the grounds. You let us have your bed.
Come along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;To&mdash;to&mdash;the Fair?&rdquo; he said, tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and when we get in I&rsquo;ll
try and think up things to tell you and Robin,
about the places we can&rsquo;t afford to go into. We
can go into the Palaces for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palaces!&rdquo; he gasped, his wide eyes on her face.</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we call them,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what they are. It&rsquo;s part of a story. I&rsquo;ll tell it to
you as we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he breathed out, with a sort of gasp,
again.</p>
<p>He evidently did not know how to express
himself. His hands trembled, and he looked half
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you
all my life! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t for father I
know mother would let you sleep here every
night for nothing. And I&rsquo;d give you my bed and
be glad to do it, I would. I&rsquo;ll be so thankful to
you. I hain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo;&mdash;nothin&rsquo;&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll be
that thankful&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;there was a kind of hysterical
break in his voice&mdash;&ldquo;let me go and tell mother,&rdquo;
he said, and he got up stumblingly and rushed
into the house.</p>
<p>Meg and Robin followed him to the kitchen, as
excited as he was. The woman had just put a
cracked bowl of something hot on the table, and
as he came in she spoke to him.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic10">
<img src="images/img011.jpg" alt="&ldquo;TO&mdash;TO&mdash;THE FAIR?&rdquo; HE SAID, TREMULOUSLY." width="600" height="768" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;TO&mdash;TO&mdash;THE FAIR?&rdquo; HE SAID, TREMULOUSLY.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your mush is ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come and
eat while it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;they are going to
take me in. I&rsquo;m going! They&rsquo;re going to take
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman stopped short and looked at the
twins, who stood in the doorway. It seemed as
if her chin rather trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going&mdash;&rdquo; she began, and broke off.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as poor as he is,&rdquo; she ended. &ldquo;You
must be, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have come here to
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re as poor in one way,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;but
we worked, and saved money to come. It isn&rsquo;t
much, but we can do without something that
would cost fifty cents, and that will pay for his
ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s chin trembled more still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &rdquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;O Lord!&rdquo; And she
threw her apron over her head and sat down
suddenly.</p>
<p>Meg went over to her, not exactly knowing
why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could not bear to go ourselves,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And he is like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking, as she spoke, that this woman
and her boy were very fond of each other. The
hands holding the apron were trembling as his
had done. They dropped as suddenly as they
had been thrown up. The woman lifted her face
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;What were you thinking of going without?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Was it things to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got some hard-boiled eggs,&rdquo; faltered
Meg, a little guiltily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hot mush in the pan,&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to eat with it, but it&rsquo;s healthier
than cold eggs. Sit down and eat some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did, and in half an hour they left the
poor house, feeling full-fed and fresh. With them
went Ben&mdash;his mother standing on the steps looking
after him&mdash;his pale old face almost flushed
and young, as it set itself toward the City
Beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">XV</span></h2>
<p>Before they entered the Court of Honor Meg
stopped them both. She was palpitating with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us make him shut his
eyes. Then you can take one of his hands and I
can take the other, and we will lead him. And
when we have taken him to the most heavenly
place, he shall look&mdash;suddenly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like that,&rdquo; said Ben, tremulous with
anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>By this time it was as if they had been friends
all their lives. They knew each other. They had
not ceased talking a moment since they set out,
but it had not been about the Fair. Meg had decided
that nothing should be described beforehand;
that all the entrancement of beauty should
burst upon Ben&rsquo;s hungry soul, as Paradise bursts
upon translated spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to be gradual,&rdquo; she said, anxiously.
&ldquo;I want it to be <i>sudden</i>! It can be gradual
after.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>She was an artist and an epicure in embryo,
this child. She tasted her joys with a delicate
palate, and lost no flavor of them. The rapture
of yesterday was intensified ten-fold to-day, because
she felt it throbbing anew in this frail body
beside her, in which Nature had imprisoned a
soul as full of longings as her own, but not so full
of power.</p>
<p>They took Ben by either hand, and led him
with the greatest care. He shut his eyes tight,
and walked between them. People who glanced
at them smiled, recognizing the time-honored and
familiar child trick. They did not know that this
time it was something more than that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; Meg said in a low voice to
Robin, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which is the most heavenly
place to stand. Sometimes I think it is at one
end, and sometimes at the other, and sometimes
at the side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led their charge for some minutes indefinitely.
Sometimes they paused and looked about
them, speaking in undertones. Ben was rigidly
faithful, and kept his eyes shut. As they hesitated
for a moment near one of the buildings, a
man who was descending the steps looked in their
direction, and his look was one of recognition.
It was the man who had watched them the day
before, and he paused upon the steps, interested
again, and conscious of being curious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are they going to do?&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;They are going to do something. Where
did they pick up the other one&mdash;poor little chap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg had been looking very thoughtful during
that moment of hesitancy. She spoke, and he was
near enough to hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall open them where he can hear the
water splashing in the fountain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
think that&rsquo;s the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed that Robin thought so, too. They
turned and took their way to the end of the Court,
where the dome lifted itself, wonderful, against
the sky, and a splendor of rushing water, from
which magnificent sea-monsters rose, stood grand
before.</p>
<p>Their man followed them. He had had a bad
night, and had come out into a dark world. The
streams of pleasure-seekers, the gayly fluttering
flags, the exhilaration in the very air seemed to
make his world blacker and more empty. A
year before he had planned to see this wonder,
with the one soul on earth who would have been
most thrilled, and who would have made him
most thrill, to its deepest and highest meaning.
Green grass and summer roses were waving over
the earth that had shut in all dreams like these,
for him. As he wandered about, he had told himself
that he had been mad to come and see it all,
so alone. Sometimes he turned away from the
crowd, and sat in some quiet corner of palace or
fairy garden; and it was because he was forced
to do it, for it was at times when he was in no
condition to be looked at by careless passers-by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>He had never been particularly fond of children;
but somehow these two waifs, with their
alert faces and odd independence, had wakened
his interest. He was conscious of rather wanting
to know where they had come from and what
they would do next. The bit of the story of the
Genius of the Palace of the Sea had attracted
him. He had learned to love stories from the
one who should have seen with him the Enchanted
City. She had been a story lover, and full of
fancies.</p>
<p>He followed the trio to the end of the great
Court. When they reached there, three pairs of
cheeks were flushed, and the eyes that were open
were glowing. Meg and Robin chose a spot of
ground, and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;open them&mdash;suddenly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy opened them. The man saw the look
that flashed into his face. It was a strange, quivering
look. Palaces, which seemed of pure marble,
surrounded him. He had never even dreamed of
palaces. White stairways rose from the lagoon,
leading to fair, open portals the wondering world
passed through to splendors held within. A
great statue of gold towered noble and marvellous,
with uplifted arms holding high the emblems
of its spirit and power, and at the end of this vista,
through the archway, and between the line of
columns, bearing statues poised against the background
of sky, he caught glimpses of the lake&rsquo;s
scintillating blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>He uttered a weird little sound. It was part
exclamation, and a bit of a laugh, cut short by
something like a nervous sob, which did not know
what to do with itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said. And then, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; again. And
then &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;what it&rsquo;s&mdash;like!&rdquo; And
he cleared his throat and stared, and Meg saw his
narrow chest heave up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t <i>like</i> anything, but&mdash;but something
we&rsquo;ve dreamed of, perhaps,&rdquo; said Meg, gazing
in ecstasy with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve never
dreamed like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg put her hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And their man had been near enough to hear,
and he came to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having
another day of it, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg and Robin looked up at him, radiant.
They were both in good enough mood to make
friends. They felt friends with everybody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; they answered; and Robin
added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to come every day as long
as we can make our money last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good enough idea,&rdquo; said their man.
&ldquo;Where are your father and mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg lifted her solemn, black-lashed eyes to his.
She was noticing again about the dreary look in
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They died nearly four years ago,&rdquo; she answered,
for Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is with you?&rdquo; asked the man, meeting
her questioning gaze with a feeling that her great
eyes were oddly thoughtful for a child&rsquo;s, and that
there was a look in them he had seen before in a
pair of eyes closed a year ago. It gave him an
almost startled feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is with us,&rdquo; Meg said, &ldquo;except Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came alone?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment in silence, and
then turned away and looked across the Court
to where the lake gleamed through the colonnade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; he said, reflectively. &ldquo;So did I.
Quite alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg and Robin glanced at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday Rob and I came by ourselves,&rdquo; said
Meg next, and she said it gently. &ldquo;But we were
not lonely; and to-day we have Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man turned his eyes on the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Ben, are you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ben answered. &ldquo;And but for them I
couldn&rsquo;t never have seen it&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Almost everybody
can see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not me,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;And I wanted to
more than any one&mdash;seemed like to me. And when
they roomed at our house last night, mother was
going to give me the fifty cents, but&mdash;but father&mdash;father,
he took it away from us. And they
brought me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man turned on Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you plenty of money?&rdquo; he asked, unceremoniously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re as poor as I am,&rdquo; put in Ben. &ldquo;They
couldn&rsquo;t afford to room anywhere but with poor
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But everybody&mdash;&rdquo; Meg began impulsively,
and then stopped, remembering that it was not
Robin she was talking to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But everybody&mdash;what?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>It was Robin who answered for her this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said that last night,&rdquo; he explained, with a
half shy laugh, &ldquo;that everybody had something
they could give to somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it isn&rsquo;t always money, of course, or
anything big,&rdquo; said Meg, hurriedly. &ldquo;It might
be something that is ever so little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>The man laughed, but his eyes seemed to be remembering
something as he looked over the lagoon
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty good thing to think,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; turning on Meg rather suddenly, &ldquo;I
wonder what you have to give to <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered, perhaps a trifle
wistfully. &ldquo;The thing I give to Rob and Ben is
a very little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She makes up things to tell us about the places
we can&rsquo;t pay to go into, or don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said
Robin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as little as she thinks it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;look here! Perhaps
that&rsquo;s what you have to give to me. You came
to this place alone and so did I. I believe you&rsquo;re
enjoying yourselves more than I am. You&rsquo;re going
to take Ben about and tell him stories. Suppose
you take me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Meg exclaimed. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a man,
and you know all about it, I dare say; and I
only tell things I make up&mdash;fairy stories, and
other things. A man wouldn&rsquo;t care for them. He&mdash;he
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows too much, perhaps&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
trouble,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;A fairy or so might do
me good. I&rsquo;m not acquainted enough with them.
And if I know things you don&rsquo;t&mdash;perhaps that&rsquo;s
what I have to give to <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Meg, her eyes growing as she
looked up at his odd, clever face, &ldquo;do you want
to go about with us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">
<img src="images/img012.jpg" alt="&ldquo;TAKE ME WITH YOU.&rdquo;" width="600" height="780" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;TAKE ME WITH YOU.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, with a quick, decided nod,
&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s just what I want to do. I&rsquo;m
lonelier than you two. At least, you are together.
Come on, children,&rdquo; but it was to Meg he held out
his hand. &ldquo;Take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, bewildered as she was, Meg found herself
giving her hand to him and being led away,
Robin and Ben close beside them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">XVI</span></h2>
<p>It was such a strange thing&mdash;so unlike the
things of every day, and so totally an unexpected
thing, that for a little while they all three had a
sense of scarcely knowing what to do with themselves.
If Robin and Meg had not somehow
rather liked the man, and vaguely felt him
friendly, and if there had not been in their impressionable
minds that fancy about his being far
from as happy as the other people of the crowds
looked, it is more than probable that they would
not have liked their position, and would have felt
that it might spoil their pleasure.</p>
<p>But they were sympathetic children, and they
had been lonely and sad enough themselves to be
moved by a sadness in others, even if it was an
uncomprehended one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>As she walked by the man&rsquo;s side, still letting
her hand remain in his, Meg kept giving him
scrutinizing looks aside, and trying in her way to
read him. He was a man just past middle life, he
was powerful and well-built, and had keen, and at
the same time rather unhappy-looking, blue eyes,
with brows and lashes as black as Rob&rsquo;s and her
own. There was something strong in his fine-looking,
clean-shaven face, and the hand which
held hers had a good, firm grasp, and felt like a
hand which had worked in its time.</p>
<p>As for the man himself, he was trying an experiment.
He had been suddenly seized with a desire
to try it, and see how it would result. He
was not sure that it would be a success, but if it
proved one it might help to rid him of gloom he
would be glad to be relieved of. He felt it rather
promising when Meg went at once to the point
and asked him a practical question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know our names?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know mine,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
John Holt. You can call me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Holt,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;Mr. John Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed. Her grave, practical little
air pleased him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say John Holt, without the handle to it,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It sounds well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg looked at him inquiringly. Though
he had laughed, he seemed to mean what he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer, of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because we
don&rsquo;t know each other well; but I can do it, if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do like,&rdquo; he said, and he laughed again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Margaret
Macleod, I&rsquo;m called Meg for short. My
brother&rsquo;s name is Robin, and Ben&rsquo;s is Ben Nowell.
Where shall we go first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the leader of the party,&rdquo; he answered,
his face beginning to brighten a little. &ldquo;Where
shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Palace of the Genius of the Flowers,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what it is called?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we call it,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the fairy story. <i>We</i> are part of
a fairy story, and all these are palaces that the
Genii built for the Great Magician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s first-rate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just tell us about
it. Ben and I have not heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first she had wondered if she could tell her
stories to a grown-up person, but there was something
in his voice and face that gave her the feeling
that she could. She laughed a little when
she began; but he listened with enjoyment that
was so plain, and Ben, walking by her side, looked
up with such eager, enraptured, and wondering
eyes, that she went on bravely. It grew, as
stories will, in being told, and it was better than
it had been the day before. Robin himself saw
that, and leaned towards her as eagerly as Ben.</p>
<p>By the time they entered the Palace of the
Flowers and stood among the flame of colors,
and beneath the great palm fronds swaying under
the crystal globe that was its dome, she had
warmed until she was all aglow, and as full of
fancies as the pavilions were of blossoms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>As she dived into the story of the Genius who
strode through tropical forests and deep jungles,
over purple moors and up mountain sides, where
strange-hued pale or vivid things grew in tangles,
or stood in the sun alone, John Holt became of
the opinion that his experiment would be a success.
It was here that he began to find he had
gifts to give. She asked him questions; Robin
and Ben asked him questions; the three drew
close to him, and hung on his every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the things and the places where
they grow,&rdquo; Meg said. &ldquo;We have never seen anything.
We can only try to imagine. You can
tell us.&rdquo; And he did tell them; and as they went
from court to pavilion, surrounded by sumptuous
bloom and sumptuous leafage and sumptuous
fragrance, the three beginning to cling to him, to
turn to him with every new discovery, and to
forget he was a stranger, he knew that he was
less gloomy than he had been before, and that
somehow this thing seemed worth doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>And in this way they went from place to place.
As they had seen beauties and wonders the day
before, they saw wonders and beauties to-day, but
to-day their pleasure had a flavor new to them.
For the first time in years, since they had left
their little seat at their own fireside, they were
not alone, and some one seemed to mean to look
after them. John Holt was an eminently practical
person, and when they left the Palace of the
Flowers they began vaguely to realize that,
stranger or not, he had taken charge of them. It
was evident that he was in the habit of taking
charge of people and things. He took charge of
the satchel. It appeared that he knew where it
was safe to leave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get it at lunch time?&rdquo; Robin asked,
with some anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get it when you want it,&rdquo; said John
Holt.</p>
<p>A little later he looked at Ben&rsquo;s pale, small face
scrutinizingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re tired.&rdquo; And
without any further question he called up a rolling-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get into that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Ben, a little alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, almost a shade paler at the thought of
such grandeur, Ben got in, and fell back with a
luxurious sigh.</p>
<p>And at midday, when they were beginning to
feel ravenous, though no one mentioned the subject,
he asked Meg a blunt question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you eat your lunch yesterday?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Meg flushed a little, feeling that hospitality demanded
that they should share the remaining eggs
with such a companion, and she was afraid there
would be very few to offer, when Ben was taken
into consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went to a quiet place on the Wooded
Island,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and ate it with the roses. We
pretended they invited us. We had only hard-boiled
eggs and a sandwich each; but a kind
woman gave us something of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We brought the eggs from home,&rdquo; explained
Rob. &ldquo;We have some chickens of our own, who
laid them. We thought that would be cheaper
than buying things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been living
on hard-boiled eggs. Got any left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few,&rdquo; Meg answered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the
satchel. We shall have to go and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;Pretty
hungry by this time, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meg, with heartfelt frankness, &ldquo;we
are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>It was astonishing how much John Holt had
found out about them during this one morning.
They did not know themselves how much their
answers to his occasional questions had told him.
He had not known himself, when he asked the
questions, how much their straightforward, practical
replies would reveal. They had not sentimentalized
over their friendless loneliness, but he
had found himself realizing what desolate, unnoticed,
and uncared-for things their lives were.
They had not told him how they had tired their
young bodies with work too heavy for them, but
he had realized it. In his mind there had risen
a picture of the Straw Parlor, under the tent-like
roof of the barn, with these two huddled together
in the cold, buried in the straw, while they talked
over their desperate plans. They had never
thought of calling themselves strong and determined,
and clear of wit, but he knew how strong
and firm of purpose and endurance two creatures
so young and unfriended, and so poor, must have
been to form a plan so bold, and carry it out in
the face of the obstacles of youth and inexperience,
and empty pockets and hands. He had
laughed at the story of the Treasure saved in
pennies, and hidden deep in the straw; but as he
had laughed he had thought, with a quick, soft
throb of his heart, that the woman he had loved
and lost would have laughed with him, with tears
in the eyes which Meg&rsquo;s reminded him of. He
somehow felt as if she might be wandering about
with them in their City Beautiful this morning,
they were so entirely creatures she would have
been drawn to, and longed to make happier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>He liked their fancy of making their poor little
feast within scent of the roses. It was just such
a fancy as She might have had herself. And he
wanted to see what they had to depend on. He
knew it must be little, and it touched him to know
that, little as they had, they meant to share it with
their poorer friend.</p>
<p>They went for the satchel, and when they did so
they began to calculate as to what they could add
to its contents. They were few things, and poor
ones.</p>
<p>He did not sit down, but stood by and watched
them for a moment, when, having reached their
sequestered nook, they began to spread out their
banquet. It was composed of the remnant eggs,
some bread, and a slice of cheese. It looked painfully
scant, and Meg had an anxious eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked John Holt, abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;We shall have to make it
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated John Holt, suddenly,
in his blunt fashion. And he turned round and
walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he gone?&rdquo; exclaimed Ben, timidly.</p>
<p>But they none of them could guess. Nice as
he had been, he had a brusque way, and, perhaps,
he meant to leave them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>But by the time they had divided the eggs, and
the bread and cheese, and had fairly begun, he
came marching back. He had a basket on his
arm, and two bottles stuck out of one coat pocket,
while a parcel protruded from the other. He
came and threw himself down on the grass beside
them, and opened the basket. It was full of good
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have lunch with you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I have a pretty big appetite, so I&rsquo;ve brought
you something to eat. You can&rsquo;t tramp about on
that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The basket they had seen the day before had
been a poor thing compared to this. The contents
of this would have been a feast for much
more fastidious creatures than three ravenous
children. There were chickens and sandwiches
and fruit; the bottles held lemonade, and the
package in the coat pocket was a box of candy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;never had such good things in our lives,&rdquo;
Meg gasped, amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said John Holt, with a kind,
and even a happy, grin. &ldquo;Well, pitch in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">XVII</span></h2>
<p>What a feast it was&mdash;what a feast! They
were so hungry, they were so happy, they were
so rejoiced! And John Holt watched them as
if he had never enjoyed himself so much before.
He laughed, he made jokes, he handed out good
things, he poured out lemonade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink to the Great Magician!&rdquo; he said,
filling the little glasses he had brought; and he
made them drink it standing, as a toast. In all
the grounds that day there was no such a party,
it was so exhilarated and amazed at itself. Little
Ben looked and ate and laughed as if the lemonade
had gone to his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if mother could see
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring her to-morrow,&rdquo; said John Holt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Meg, looking at him with
wide eyes, &ldquo;are you coming again to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; John Holt answered, &ldquo;and you are
coming with me; and we&rsquo;ll come every day until
you&rsquo;ve seen it all&mdash;if you three will pilot me
around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must be very rich, John Holt,&rdquo; said Meg.
She had found out that it was his whim to want
her to call him so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have plenty of money,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s
being rich. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve got money enough!
I&rsquo;ve more land than Aunt Matilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then it was that suddenly Robin remembered
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve heard Aunt
Matilda speak about you to Jones. I seem to
remember your name. You have the biggest
farm in Illinois, and you have houses and houses
in town. Meg, don&rsquo;t you remember&mdash;when he
got married, and everybody talked about how
rich he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Meg did remember. She looked at him
softly, and thought she knew why he had seemed
gloomy, for she remembered that this rich and
envied man&rsquo;s wife had had a little child and died
suddenly. And she had even heard once that it
had almost driven him mad, because he had been
fond of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;that one?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who got
married.&rdquo; And the cloud fell on his face again,
and for a minute or so rested there. For he
thought this thing which had happened to him
was cruel and hideous, and he had never ceased
to rebel against it bitterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Meg drew a little closer to him, but she said no
more about what she knew he was thinking of.
She was a clever little thing, and knew this was
not the time.</p>
<p>And after they had eaten of the good things,
until hunger seemed a thing of the past, the afternoon
began as a fairy story, indeed. Little by
little they began to realize that John Holt was
their good and powerful giant, for it seemed that
he was not only ready to do everything for them,
but was rich enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been to the Midway Plaisance?&rdquo;
he asked them. He felt very sure, however, that
they had not, or that, if they had, with that scant
purse, they had not seen what they longed to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;We thought we
would save it until we had seen so many other
things that we should not mind so <i>very</i> much
only seeing the outsides of places. We knew we
should have to make up stories all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t save it,&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go now. We will hobnob with Bedouins and
Japanese and Turks, and shake hands with Amazons
and Indians; we&rsquo;ll ride on camels and go to
the Chinese Theatre. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>And to this Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment he
took them all. They felt as if he were a prince.
And oh, the exciting strangeness of it! To be in
such a place and amid such marvels, with a man
who seemed to set no limit to the resources of
his purse. They never had been even near a
person who spent money as if it were made for
spending, and the good things of life were made
to be bought by it. What John Holt spent was
only what other people with full purses spent in
the Midway Plaisance, but to Meg and Robin
and Ben it seemed that he poured forth money
in torrents. They looked at him with timorous
wonder and marvelling gratitude. It seemed
that he meant them to see everything and to do
everything. They rode on camels down a street
in Cairo, they talked to chiefs of the desert, they
listened to strange music, they heard strange
tongues, and tasted strange confections. Robin
and Ben went about like creatures in a delightful
dream. Every few minutes during the first hour
Robin would sidle close to Meg, and clutch her
dress or her hand with a gasp of rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Meg!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;and yesterday we
were so poor! And now we are seeing <i>everything</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when John Holt heard him, he would
laugh half to himself; a laugh with a touch of
pleasant exultation in it, and no gloom at all. He
had found something to distract him at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>He liked to watch Meg&rsquo;s face, as they went
from one weirdly foreign place to another. Her
eyes were immense with delight, and her face had
the flush of an Indian peach. Once she stopped
suddenly, in such a glow of strange delight that
her eyes were full of other brightness than the
shining of her pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy stories <i>do</i> happen!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
have made one! It was a fairy story yesterday&mdash;but
<i>now</i>&mdash;oh! just think how like a fairy king
you are, and what you are giving to us! It will
be enough to make stories of forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed again. She found out in time that
he often laughed that short half-laugh when he
was moved by something. He had had a rough
sort of life, successful as it had been, and it was
not easy for him to express all he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just as it
should be. But you are giving something to me,
too&mdash;you three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they were, and it was not a little thing.</p>
<p>Their afternoon was a thing of which they
could never have dreamed and for which they
could never have hoped. Before it was half over
they began to feel that not only John Holt was a
prince, but that by some magic metamorphosis
they had become princes themselves. It seemed
that nothing in that City Beautiful was to be
closed to them. It was John Holt&rsquo;s habit to do
things in a thorough, business-like way, and he did
this thing in a manner which was a credit to his
wit and good sense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Ben, who had never been taken care of in his
life, was taken about in a chair, and looked after
in a way that made him wonder if he were not
dreaming, and if he should not be wakened presently
by the sound of his father&rsquo;s drunken voice.</p>
<p>Robin found himself more than once rubbing
his forehead in a puzzled fashion.</p>
<p>Meg felt rather as if she had become a princess.
Somehow, she and John Holt seemed to have
known each other a long time. He seemed to
like to keep her near him, and always kept his
eye on her, to see if she was enjoying herself,
and was comfortable, or tired. She found herself
being wheeled by Ben, when John Holt decided it
was time for her to rest. He walked by her and
talked to her, answering all her questions. More
than once it flashed into her mind that it would
be very awful when all this joy was over, and they
parted, as they would. But they were going to
see him to-morrow, he had said.</p>
<p>It seemed as if they marched from one climax
of new experience to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to dine with me,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had enough hard-boiled eggs. And
we&rsquo;ll see the illuminations afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>He took them to what seemed to them a dining-place
for creatures of another world, it was so
brilliant with light, so decorated, so gorgeous.
Servants moved to and fro, electric globes
gleamed, palms and flowers added to the splendor
of color and brightness. John Holt gave
them an excellent dinner; they thought it was a
banquet. Ben kept his eyes on John Holt&rsquo;s face
at every mouthful&mdash;he felt as if he might vanish
away. He looked as if he had done this every
day of his life. He called the waiters as if he
knew no awe of any human being, and the waiters
flew to obey him.</p>
<p>In the evening he took them to see the City Beautiful
as it looked at night. It was set, it seemed
to them, with myriads of diamonds, all alight.
Endless chains of jewels seemed strung and
wound about it. The Palace of the Flowers held
up a great crystal of light glowing against the
dark blue of the sky, towers and domes were
crowned and diademed, thousands of jewels hung
among the masses of leaves, or reflected themselves,
sparkling, in the darkness of the lagoons,
fountains of molten jewels sprung up, and flamed
and changed. The City Beautiful stood out
whiter and more spirit-like than ever, in the pure
radiance of these garlands of clearest flame.</p>
<p>When first they came out upon it Robin involuntarily
pressed close to Meg, and their twin
hands clasped each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Meg!&rdquo; cried Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robin!&rdquo; breathed Meg, and she turned to
John Holt and caught his hand too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John Holt!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;John Holt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Very primitive and brief exclamations of joy,
but somehow human beings have uttered them
just as simply in all great moments through centuries.</p>
<p>John Holt knew just the degree of rapturous
feeling they expressed, and he held Meg&rsquo;s hand
close and with a warm grasp.</p>
<p>They saw the marvellous fairy spectacle from
all points and from all sides. Led by John Holt,
they lost no view and no beauty. They feasted
full of all the delight of it; and at last he took
them to a quiet corner, where, through the trees,
sparkled lights and dancing water, and let them
talk it out.</p>
<p>The day had been such an incredible one, with
its succession of excitements and almost unreal
pleasures, that they had actually forgotten that
the night must come. They were young enough
for that indiscretion, and when they sat down and
began to realize how tired they were, they also
began to realize a number of other things.</p>
<p>A little silence fell upon them. Ben&rsquo;s head began
to droop slightly upon his shoulder, and
John Holt&rsquo;s quick eye saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had a good day?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rob,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;when we sat in the Straw
Parlor and talked about the City Beautiful, and
the people who would come to it&mdash;when we
thought we could never see it ourselves&mdash;did we
ever dream that anybody&mdash;even if they were
kings and queens&mdash;could have such a day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; answered Robin; &ldquo;never! We
didn&rsquo;t know such a day was in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s
seemed as good as that. Now, where did you
think of spending the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg and Rob looked at each other. Since
Rob had suggested to her in the morning a bold
thought, they had had no time to discuss the
matter, but now each one remembered the bold
idea. Rob got up and came close to John Holt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning I thought of something,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and once again this afternoon I thought of
it. I don&rsquo;t know whether we could do it, but
you could tell us. Do you think&mdash;this is such a
big place and there are so many corners we could
creep into, and it&rsquo;s such a fine night&mdash;do you
think we could wait until all the people are gone
and then find a place to sleep without going out
of the grounds? It would save us buying the
tickets in the morning, and Ben could stay with
us&mdash;I told his mother that perhaps he might not
come home&mdash;and he could have another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Holt laughed his short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you thinking of doing that?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Well, you have plenty of sand, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could do it?&rdquo; asked Meg.
&ldquo;Would they find us and drive us out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>John Holt laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no; I don&rsquo;t think
they&rsquo;d find you two. Luck would be with you.
But I know a plan worth two of that. I&rsquo;m going
to take you all three to my hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hotel?&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>Ben lifted his sleepy head from his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;I can make them find
corners for you, though they&rsquo;re pretty crowded.
I&rsquo;m not going to lose sight of you. This has begun
to be <i>my</i> tea-party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg looked at him with large and solemn eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fairy story, and it&rsquo;s getting
fairyer and fairyer every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned forward, with her heart quite throbbing.
Because it was he who did this splendid
thing&mdash;he to whom all things seemed possible&mdash;it
actually seemed a thing to be accepted as if a magician
had done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how good you are to us!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;How good, and how good! And what is the
use of saying only &lsquo;Thank you?&rsquo; I should not be
surprised,&rdquo; with a touch of awe, &ldquo;if you took us
to a hotel built of <i>gold</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How heartily John Holt laughed then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some of them ought to be, by the time
this thing&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the lights will
soon be out; the people are going, and Ben&rsquo;s
nearly dead. Let&rsquo;s go and find a carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">XVIII</span></h2>
<p>Yes, they went home in a carriage! John Holt
put them into it, and settled back into it himself,
as if comfortable cushions were only what belonged
to tired people. And he took them to one
of the hotels whose brilliantly-lighted fronts they
had trudged wearily by the night before. And
they had a good supper and warm baths and delicious
beds, and Meg went to sleep with actual
tears of wonder and gratitude on her lashes, and
they all three slept the sleep of Eden and dreamed
the dreams of Paradise. And in the morning
they had breakfast with John Holt, in the hotel
dining-room, and a breakfast as good as the
princely dinner he had given them; and after it
they all went back with him to the City Beautiful,
and the fairy story began again. For near
the entrance where they went in they actually
found Ben&rsquo;s mother, in a state of wonder beyond
words; for, by the use of some magic messenger,
that wonderful John Holt had sent word to her
that Ben was in safe hands, and that she must
come and join him, and the money to make this
possible had been in the letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Poor, tired, discouraged, down-trodden woman,
how she lost her breath when Ben threw himself
upon her and poured forth his story! And what
a face she wore through all that followed! How
Ben led her from triumph to triumph, with the
exultant air of one to whom the City Beautiful
almost belonged, and who, consequently, had it to
bestow as a rich gift on those who did not know
it as he did. What wondering glances his mother
kept casting on his face, which had grown younger
with each hour! She had never seen him
look like this before. And what glances she cast
aside at John Holt! This was one of the rich
men poor people heard of. She had never been
near one of them. She had, often, rather hated
them.</p>
<p>Before the day was over Robin and Meg realized
that this wonder was to go on as long as
there was anything of the City Beautiful they had
not seen. They were to drink deep draughts of
delight as long as they were thirsty for more.
John Holt made this plain to them in his blunt,
humorous way. He was going to show them
everything and share all their pleasures, and they
were to stay at the golden hotel every night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>And John Holt was getting almost as much out
of it as they were. He wandered about alone no
more; he did not feel as if he were only a ghost,
with nothing in common with the human beings
passing by. In the interest and excitement of
generalship and management, and the amusement
of seeing this unspoiled freshness of his charges&rsquo;
delight in all things, the gloomy look faded out
of his face, and he looked like a different man.
Once they came upon two men who seemed to
know him, and the first one who spoke to him
glanced at the children in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, John!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;set up a family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; answered John Holt.
&ldquo;Set up a family. A man&rsquo;s no right to be going
around a place like this without one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you get on with it?&rdquo; asked the other.
&ldquo;Find it pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay!&rdquo; said John Holt, with a big laugh.
&ldquo;Great Scott! I should say so! It&rsquo;s worth
twice the price of admission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad of it,&rdquo; said his friend, giving him a
curious look.</p>
<p>And as he went away Meg heard him say to
his companion,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was time he found something that paid&mdash;John
Holt. He was in a pretty bad way&mdash;a <i>pretty</i>
bad way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>As they became more and more intimate, and
spoke more to each other, Meg understood how
bad a &ldquo;way&rdquo; he had been in. She was an observing,
old-fashioned child, and she saw many
things a less sympathetic creature might have
passed by; and when John Holt discovered this&mdash;which
he was quite shrewd enough to do rather
soon&mdash;he gradually began to say things to her he
would not have said to other people. She understood,
somehow, that, though the black look passed
away from his face, and he laughed and made
them laugh, there was a thing that was never
quite out of his mind. She saw that pictures
brought it back to him, that strains of music did,
that pretty mothers with children hurt him when
they passed, and that every now and then he
would cast a broad glance over all the whiteness
and blueness and beauty and grace, and draw a
long, quick sigh&mdash;as if he were homesick for
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said once, when he did this
and looked round, and found Meg&rsquo;s eyes resting
yearningly upon him, &ldquo;you know She was coming
with me! We planned it all. Lord! how
She liked to talk of it! She said it would be an
Enchanted City&mdash;just as you did, Meg. That
was one of the first things that made me stop
to listen&mdash;when I heard you say that. An Enchanted
City!&rdquo; he repeated, pondering. &ldquo;Lord,
Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Meg, with a little catch in her
breath, &ldquo;well, you know, John Holt, she&rsquo;s got to
an Enchanted City that won&rsquo;t vanish away, hasn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>She did not say it with any sanctified little air.
Out of their own loneliness, and the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress,&rdquo; and her ardent fancies, the place she
and Robin had built to take refuge in was a very
real thing. It had many modern improvements
upon the vagueness of harps and crowns. There
were good souls who might have been astounded
and rather shocked by it, but the children believed
in it very implicitly, and found great comfort
in their confidence in its joyfulness. They
thought of themselves as walking about its streets
exactly as rapturously as they walked about this
earthly City Beautiful. And because it was so
real there was a note in Meg&rsquo;s voice which gave
John Holt a sudden touch of new feeling, as he
looked back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose she is?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You believe
in that, don&rsquo;t you&mdash;you believe in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg looked a little troubled for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Rob and I talk to each
other and invent things about it, just as we talked
about this. We just <i>have</i> to, you see. Perhaps
we say things that would seem very funny to religious
people&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re religious but&mdash;but
we do <i>like</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;Perhaps I
should, too. You shall tell me some stories about
it, and you shall put Her there. If I could feel
as if she were somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;she must be somewhere, you
know. She couldn&rsquo;t <i>go out</i>, John Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cast his broad glance all around, and caught
his breath, as if remembering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No! <i>She</i> couldn&rsquo;t
go out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg knew afterwards why he said this with
such force. &ldquo;She&rdquo; had been a creature who was
so full of life, and of the joy of living. She had
been gay, and full of laughter and humor. She
had had a wonderful, vivid mind, which found
color and feeling and story in the commonest
things. She had been so clever and so witty, and
such a bright and warm thing in her house.
When she had gone away from earth so suddenly,
people had said, with wonder, &ldquo;But it seemed as
if she <i>could</i> not die!&rdquo; But she had died, and her
child had died too, scarcely an hour after it was
born, and John Holt had been left stunned and
aghast, and almost stricken into gloomy madness.
And in some way Meg was like her, with her
vivid little face and her black-lashed eyes, her
City Beautiful and her dreams and stories, which
made the realities of her life. It was a strange
chance, a marvellously kind chance, which had
thrown them together; these two, who were of
such different worlds, and yet, who needed each
other so much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>During the afternoon, seeing that Meg looked
a little tired, and also realizing, in his practical
fashion, that Ben&rsquo;s mother would be more at ease
in the society she was used to, John Holt sent her
to ramble about with her boy, and Robin went
with them; and Meg and John went to rest with
the thousands of roses among the bowers of the
fairy island, and there they said a good deal to
each other. John Holt seemed to get a kind of
comfort in finding words for some of the thoughts
he had been silent about in the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but when I talk
to you about her I feel as if she were somewhere
near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she is,&rdquo; said Meg, in her matter-of-fact
little way. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what they are
doing. But if you had gone into another world,
and she had stayed here, you know you would
have come to take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;I took care of
her when she was here, the Lord knows. There
wasn&rsquo;t anything on earth she liked that I wouldn&rsquo;t
have broken my neck to get at. When I built
that house for her&mdash;I built a big house to take
her to when we were married&mdash;she said I hadn&rsquo;t
left out a thing she cared for. And she <i>knew</i>
what things ought to be. She wasn&rsquo;t like me,
Meg. I&rsquo;d spent my life trying to make a fortune.
I began when I was a boy, and I worked hard.
She belonged to people with money, and she&rsquo;d
read books and travelled and seen things. She
knew it all. I didn&rsquo;t, when first I knew her, but
I learned fast enough afterwards. I couldn&rsquo;t
help it while I was with her. We planned the
house together. It was one of the best in the
country&mdash;architecture, furniture, pictures, and all
the rest. The first evening we spent there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He stopped and cleared his throat, and was silent
a few seconds. Then he added, in a rather
unsteady voice, &ldquo;We were pretty happy people
that evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later he showed Meg her miniature. He carried
it in an oval case in his inside pocket. It
was the picture of a young woman with a brilliant
face, lovely laughing eyes, and a bright,
curving red mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, as he looked at it, &ldquo;She <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
go out. She&rsquo;s somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told Meg about the rooms they had
made ready for &ldquo;John Holt, Junior,&rdquo; as they
had called the little child who died so quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was her idea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was a
nursery, with picture paper on the walls. There
was a bathroom, with tiles that told stories about
little mermen and mermaids, that she had made
up herself. There was a bedroom, with a swinging
cot, frilled with lace and tied with ribbons.
And there were picture-books and toys. The
doors never were opened. John Holt, Junior,
never slept in his cot. He slept with his
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>There he broke off a moment again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to be sorry he wouldn&rsquo;t be old
enough to appreciate all this,&rdquo; he said next.
&ldquo;She used to laugh about him, and say, he was
going to be cheated out of it. But she said he
should come with us, so that he could say he had
been. She said he had to see it, if he only stared
at it and said &lsquo;goo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he does see it,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;I should
think those who have got away from here, and
know more what being alive really means, would
want to see what earth people are <i>trying</i> to do&mdash;though
they know so little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds pretty good,&rdquo; said John Holt;
&ldquo;I like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been seated long enough to feel
rested, and they rose and went on their way, to
begin their pilgrimage again. Just as they were
crossing the bridge they saw Robin coming tearing
towards them. He evidently had left Ben
and his mother somewhere. He was alone. His
hat was on the back of his head, and he was hot
with running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;and I
believe I know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Robin had reached them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meg,&rdquo; he said, panting for breath, &ldquo;Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s
here! She didn&rsquo;t see me, but I saw her.
She&rsquo;s in the Agricultural Building, standing before
a new steam plough, and she&rsquo;s chewing a
sample of wheat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">XIX</span></h2>
<p>The two children did not know exactly whether
they were frightened or not. If it had not
seemed impossible that anything should go entirely
wrong while John Holt was near them,
they would have felt rather queer. But John
Holt was evidently not the least alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it. I want
to see that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; exclaimed Robin and Meg together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come along, and let&rsquo;s
go and find her.&rdquo; And he strode out towards
the Agricultural Building as if he were going
towards something interesting.</p>
<p>It is true that the Agricultural Building had
been too nearly connected with Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s
world to hold the greatest attractions for the little
Pilgrims. It had, indeed, gone rather hard with
them to find a name for it with a beautiful sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it <i>is</i> something,&rdquo; Meg had said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
a great, huge thing, whether we care for it or not.
That it isn&rsquo;t the thing we care for doesn&rsquo;t make
it any less. We should be fools if we thought
that, of course. And you know we&rsquo;re not fools,
Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rob had said, standing gazing at rakes
and harrows with his brows knit and his legs
pretty wide apart. &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s one thing
that shows human beings <i>can</i> do what they set
their minds to, it&rsquo;s this place. Why, they used
to thresh wheat with flails&mdash;two pieces of wood
hooked together. They banged the wheat on the
barn floor with things like that! I&rsquo;ll tell you
what, as soon as a man gets any sense, he begins
to make machines. He bangs at things with his
brain, instead of with his arms and legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the end they had called it the Palace of
the Genius of the Garth, and the Seasons, and
the Sun. They walked manfully by John Holt
through the place, Robin leading the way, until
they came to the particular exhibit where he had
caught sight of Aunt Matilda. Being a business-like
and thorough person, she was still there,
though she had left the steam plough and directed
her attention to a side-delivery hay rake, which
she seemed to find very well worth study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>If the children and John Holt had not walked
up and planted themselves immediately in her
path, she would not have seen them. It gave
Meg a little shudder to see how like her world
she looked, with her hard, strong-featured face,
her straight skirt, and her square shoulders. They
waited until she moved, and then she looked up
and saw them. She did not start or look nervous
in the least. She stared at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So this was the place you
came to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Matilda,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t
let it go by us&mdash;and we took our own money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we knew you wouldn&rsquo;t be anxious about
us,&rdquo; said Meg, looking up at her with a shade of
curiosity.</p>
<p>Aunt Matilda gave a dry laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time to be anxious
about children. I took care of myself when I was
your age; and I had a sort of notion you&rsquo;d come
here. Who are you with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Holt lifted his hat, but without too much
ceremony. He knew Mrs. Matilda Jennings&rsquo;s
principles were opposed to the ceremonious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sort of neighbor of yours, Mrs. Jennings,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;I have some land near
your farm, though I don&rsquo;t live on the place. My
name is John Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Matilda glanced from him to Robin.</p>
<p>She knew all about John Holt, and was quite
sufficiently business-like to realize that it would
be considered good luck to have him for a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said to them, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got into
good hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Holt laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;By this time we all three think we&rsquo;ve got into
good hands,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going to see
this thing through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t money enough to see much of
it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John Holt, &ldquo;but I have, and it&rsquo;s to
be my treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aunt Matilda, &ldquo;I suppose you
can afford it. I couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve come here on
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better let us help you to combine a
little pleasure with it,&rdquo; said John Holt. &ldquo;This
won&rsquo;t happen twice in your life or mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of money wasted in decorations,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Jennings. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it
will pay them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; it will pay them,&rdquo; said John Holt.
&ldquo;It would pay them if they didn&rsquo;t make a cent
out of it. It would have paid <i>me</i>, if I&rsquo;d done it,
and lost money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Matilda Jennings,
with a shrewd air, &ldquo;the people that built this
didn&rsquo;t do it for their health&mdash;they did it for what
they&rsquo;d make out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they did,&rdquo; said John Holt, &ldquo;and perhaps
all of them didn&rsquo;t. And even those that did
have made a bigger thing than they knew, by
Jupiter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>They were all sauntering along together, as
they spoke. Meg and Robin wondered what
John Holt was going to do. It looked rather as
if he wanted to see more of Aunt Matilda. And
it proved that he did. He had a reason of his
own, and, combined with this, a certain keen sense
of humor made her entertaining to him. He wanted
to see how the place affected her, as he had
wanted to look on at its effect on Meg and Robin.
But he knew that Aunt Matilda had come to accumulate
new ideas on agriculture, and that she
must be first allowed to satisfy herself on that
point; and he knew the children were not specially
happy in the society of ploughs and threshing-machines,
and he did not think Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s
presence would add to their pleasure in the Palace
of the Earth, the Seasons, and the Sun. Besides,
he wanted to talk to Mrs. Jennings a little
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where Ben and his mother are?&rdquo;
he said to Robin, after a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Robin answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take Meg and go to them for a while.
Mrs. Jennings wants to stay here about an hour
more, and I want to walk round with her. In an
hour come back to the entrance here and I will
meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg and Robin went away as he told them.
It was in one sense rather a relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she&rsquo;ll say to him,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing,&rdquo; Robin answered. &ldquo;But
whatever it is, he will make it all right. He&rsquo;s one
of those who have found out human beings can
do things if they try hard enough. He was as
lonely and poor as we are when he was twelve.
He told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Aunt Matilda said was very matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; she said, as the children walked
off, &ldquo;you seem to have been pretty good to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been pretty good to me,&rdquo; said John
Holt. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been pretty good <i>for</i> me, though
they&rsquo;re not old enough to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re older than their age,&rdquo; said Aunt Matilda.
&ldquo;If they&rsquo;d been like other children the
Lord knows what I should have done with them.
They&rsquo;ve been no trouble in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should imagine not,&rdquo; said John Holt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was pretty business-like of them,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Jennings, with another dry laugh, &ldquo;to make up
their minds without saying a word to any one,
and just hustle around and make their money to
come here. They both worked pretty steady, I
can tell you, and it wasn&rsquo;t easy work, either. Most
young ones would have given in. But they were
bound to get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be bound to get pretty much where
they make up their minds to, as life goes on,&rdquo;
remarked John Holt. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s their build.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, they&rsquo;re not like their father,&rdquo;
Mrs. Jennings commented. &ldquo;Robert hadn&rsquo;t
any particular fault, but he never made anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and his wife seem to have made a home
that was a pretty good start for these children,&rdquo;
was what John Holt said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jennings, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got to do
the rest themselves. He left them nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other relations but you?&rdquo; John Holt
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul. I shall keep them and let them
work on the farm, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would pay to educate them well and let
them see the world,&rdquo; said John Holt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it would pay <i>them</i>,&rdquo; replied Aunt
Matilda, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got all I can do, and my husband&rsquo;s
family have a sort of claim on me. Half
the farm belonged to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent their remaining hours in the Agricultural
Building very profitably. Mrs. Jennings
found John Holt an excellent companion. He
knew things very thoroughly, and had far-seeing
ideas of how far things would work, and how
much they would pay. He did not expect Mrs.
Jennings to tell him fairy stories, and he told her
none, but before they left the place they had
talked a good deal. John Holt had found out
all he wanted to know about the two children,
and he had made a proposition which certainly
gave Aunt Matilda something new to think of.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>She was giving some thought to it when they
went out to meet the party of four at the entrance.
She looked as if she had been rather surprised
by some occurrence, but she did not look
displeased, and the glances she gave to Meg and
Robin expressed a new sense of appreciation of
their practical value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised Mr. Holt that I&rsquo;ll let him take
me through the Midway Plaisance,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the things I came to see, and I may
as well get my ticket&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg and Robin regarded her with interest.
Aunt Matilda and the Midway Plaisance, taken
together, would be such a startling contrast that
they must be interesting. And as she looked at
John Holt&rsquo;s face, as they went on their way, Meg
knew he was thinking the same thing. And it
was a strange experience. Mrs. Jennings strode
through the curious places rather as if she were
following a plough down a furrow. She looked at
Samoan beauties, Arab chiefs, and Persian Jersey
Lilies with unmovedly scrutinizing eyes. She
did not waste time anywhere, but she took all in
as if it were a matter of business. Camel drivers
and donkey boys seemed to strike her merely as
samples of slow travelling; she ascended, as it
were into mid-heaven, on the Ferris Wheel, with
a grim air of determination. Being so lifted from
earth and poised above in the clear air, Meg had
thrilled with a strange, exultant feeling of being
a bird, and it had seemed to her that, with a moment&rsquo;s
flutter of wings, she could soar higher and
higher, and lose herself in the pure sea of blue
above. Aunt Matilda looked down with cool interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty big power this,&rdquo; she said to John Holt.
&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s made one man&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Holt was a generous host. He took her
from place to place&mdash;to Lapland villages, Cannibal
huts, and Moorish palaces. She tramped
about, and inspected them all with a sharp, unenthusiastic
eye. She looked at the men and
women, and their strange costumes, plainly thinking
them rather mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer sight,&rdquo; she said to John Holt;
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what good all this is going to
do any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It saves travelling expenses,&rdquo; answered John
Holt, laughing. His shrewd, humorous face was
very full of expression all the time they were
walking about together. She had only come for
the day, and she was going back by a night train.
When she left them, she gave them both one of
those newly appreciative looks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr. Holt&rsquo;s going to look
after you, he says. He&rsquo;s got something to tell
you when I&rsquo;m gone. We&rsquo;ve talked it over, and
it&rsquo;s all right. There&rsquo;s one thing sure, you&rsquo;re two
of the luckiest young ones <i>I</i>&rsquo;ve heard of.&rdquo; And
she marched away briskly.</p>
<p>Meg and Robin looked at each other and at
John Holt. What was he going to tell them?
But he told them nothing until they had all
dined, and Ben and his mother had gone home,
prepared to come again the next day.</p>
<p>By that time the City Beautiful was wreathed
with its enchanted jewels of light again, and in
the lagoon&rsquo;s depths they trembled and blazed.
John Holt called a gondola with a brilliant gondolier,
and they got into it and shot out into the
radiant night.</p>
<p>The sight was so unearthly in its beauty that
for a few moments they were quite still. Meg
sat in her Straw Parlor attitude, with her elbows
on her knees, and her chin on her hands. Her
eyes looked very big, and as lustrous as the
jewels in the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you something,&rdquo; said John
Holt, in a quiet sort of voice, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meg, dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you two like to belong to <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s hands dropped, and she turned her shining
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to your Aunt Matilda about
that big house of mine,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty.
There&rsquo;s too much room in it. I want to take
you two, and see if you can fill it up. Will you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic12">
<img src="images/img013.jpg" alt="&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S A QUEER SIGHT,&rdquo; SHE SAID TO JOHN HOLT." width="600" height="771" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S A QUEER SIGHT,&rdquo; SHE SAID TO JOHN HOLT.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Meg and Robin turned their eyes upon each
other in a dazed way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we come?&rdquo; they stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jennings is willing,&rdquo; said John Holt.
&ldquo;You two have things to do in the world. I&rsquo;ll
help you to learn to do them. You,&rdquo; with the
short laugh&mdash;&ldquo;you shall tell me fairy stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fairy stories! What was this? Their hearts
beat in their breasts like little hammers. The
gondola moved smoothly over the scintillating
water, and the jewel-strung towers and domes
rose white against the lovely night. Meg looked
around her, and uttered a little cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rob!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, dear John Holt.
We have got <i>into</i> the City Beautiful, and you are
going to let us live there always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And John Holt knew that the big house would
seem empty no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">XX</span></h2>
<p>It would have seemed that this was the climax
of wonders and delights&mdash;to know that they had
escaped forever from Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world, that
they were not to be parted from John Holt, that
they were to be like his children, living with him,
sharing his great house, and learning all they could
want to learn. All this, even when it was spoken
of as possible, seemed more than could be believed,
but it seemed almost more unbelievable day by
day, as the truth began to realize itself in detail.
What a marvellous thing it was to find out that
they were not lonely, uncared-for creatures any
more, but that they belonged to a man who
seemed to hold all power in his hands! When
John Holt took them to the big stores and bought
them all they needed, new clothes and new
trunks and new comforts, and luxuries such
as they had never thought of as belonging to
them, they felt almost aghast. He was so
practical, and seemed to know so well how to do
everything, that each hour convinced them more
and more that everything was possible to him.
And he seemed to like so much to be with them.
Day after day he took them to their City Beautiful,
and enjoyed with them every treasure in it.
And they had so much time before them, they
could see it all at rapturous leisure and ease. No
more hungry hours, no more straining of tired
bodies and spurring of weary feet, because there
was so much to see and so little time to see it in,
because there was so little money to be spent.
There was time to loiter through palaces and
linger before pictures and marvellous things.
And John Holt could explain them all. No more
limited and vague imaginings. There was time to
hear everything, and Meg could tell fairy stories
by the hour if she was in the mood. She told
them in tropical bowers; she told them as they
floated on the lagoon; she read them in strange,
savage, or oriental faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have enough to last all my life, John
Holt,&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;I see a new one every
half-hour. If you like, I will tell them all to you
and Robin when you have nothing else to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be like the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Robin. &ldquo;Meg, do you remember that old book
we had where all the leaves we wanted most were
torn out, and we had to make the rest up ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>There was one story Meg found John Holt
liked better than all the rest. It was the one about
the City Beautiful, into which she used to follow
Christian in the days when she and Robin lay in
the Straw Parlor. It had grown so real to her
that she made it very real and near in the telling.
John Holt liked the way she had of filling it with
people and things she knew quite well. Meg was
very simple about it all, but she told that story
well and often, when they were resting in some
beautiful place alone. John Holt would lead her
back to it, and sit beside her, listening, with a
singular expression in his eyes. Ah, those were
wonderful days!</p>
<p>Ben and his mother shared them, though they
were not always with John Holt and Robin and
Meg. John Holt made comfortable plans for
them, and let them wander about and look their
fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great thing for <i>him</i>, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; said the
poor woman once, with a side glance at Ben.
&ldquo;Seems like he&rsquo;s been born over again. The way
he talks, when we go home at night, is as if he&rsquo;d
never be tired again as long as he lives. And a
month ago I used to think he&rsquo;d wear himself out,
fretting. Seemed like I could see him getting
thinner and peakeder every day. My, it&rsquo;s a wonderful
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>And John Holt&rsquo;s kindness did not end there,
though it was some time before Meg and Robin
heard all he had done. One day, when they had
left the grounds earlier than usual, because they
were tired, he spent the evening in searching out
Ben&rsquo;s disreputable father, and giving him what he
called &ldquo;a straight talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep my
eye on that boy of yours and your wife. I intend
to make the house decent, and see that the boy
has a chance to learn something, and take care
they&rsquo;re not too hard run. But I&rsquo;m going to keep
my eye on you too&mdash;at least, I shall see that some
one else does&mdash;and if you make things uncomfortable
you&rsquo;ll be made pretty uncomfortable yourself,
that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;d advise you to try the new recreation
of going to work. It&rsquo;ll be good for your
health. Sort of athletics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he kept his word.</p>
<p>It was a marvel of a holiday. It is not possible
that among all the holiday-makers there were two
others who were nearer the rapture of Paradise
than these two little Pilgrims.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>When it was at an end they went home with
John Holt. It was a wonderful home-going. The
house was a wonderful house. It was one of the
remarkable places that some self-made western
men have built and furnished, with the aid of unlimited
fortunes and the unlimited shrewd good
sense which has taught most of those of them
whose lives have been spent in work and bold
ventures that it is more practical to buy taste and
experience than to spend money without it. John
Holt had also had the aid and taste of a wonderful
little woman, whose life had been easier and
whose world had been broader than his own.
Together they had built a beautiful and lovable
home to live in. It contained things from many
countries, and its charm and luxury might well
have been the result of a far older civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Robin,&rdquo; said Meg, in a low
voice, the first evening, as they sat in a deep-cushioned
window-seat in the library together,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you know what She was
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had spoken together of her often, and
somehow it was always in a rather low voice, and
they always called her &ldquo;She.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin looked up from the book he held on his
knee. It was a beautiful volume She had been
fond of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know why you say that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
mean that somehow the house is like her. Yes, I&rsquo;m
sure it is, just as Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s house is like her.
People&rsquo;s houses are always like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is full of her,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;I should
think John Holt would feel as if she must be in it,
and she might speak to him any moment. I feel
as if she might speak to me. And it isn&rsquo;t only the
pictures of her everywhere, with her eyes laughing
at you from the wall and the tables and the
mantels. It&rsquo;s <i>herself</i>. Perhaps it is because she
helped John Holt to choose things, and was so
happy here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is,&rdquo; said Robin; and he added,
softly, &ldquo;this was her book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went once more to Aunt Matilda&rsquo;s world.
They did it because John Holt wanted to see the
Straw Parlor, and they wanted to show it to him
and bid it good-by.</p>
<p>Aunt Matilda treated them with curious consideration.
It almost seemed as if she had begun
to regard them with respect. It seemed to her
that any business-like person would respect two
penniless children who had made themselves attractive
to a man with the biggest farm in Illinois,
and other resources still larger. They went out
to the barn in their old way, when no one knew
where they were going, and when no one was
about to see them place their ladder against the
stack, and climb up to the top. The roof seemed
more like a dark tent than ever, and they saw
the old birds&rsquo; nests, which by this time were
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;do you remember the
day we lay in the straw and told each other we
had got work? And do you remember the afternoon
I climbed up with the old coffee-pot, to boil
the eggs in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we counted the Treasure?&rdquo; said
Meg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;And when we talked about miracles?&rdquo; said
Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when it made me think human beings
could do anything if they tried hard enough?&rdquo;
said Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you read the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rsquo;?&rdquo;
said John Holt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first afternoon when we listened to
Jones and Jerry, and you said there <i>was</i> a City
Beautiful?&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there <i>was</i>,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve been
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just this time in the afternoon,&rdquo; said
Meg, looking about her; &ldquo;the red light was
dying away, for I could not see to read any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for a little while they sat in the Straw Parlor,
while the red light waned; and afterwards,
when they spoke of it, they found they were all
thinking of the same thing, and it was of the last
day they had spent at the Enchanted City, when
they had gone about together in a strange, tender,
half-sad mood, loitering through the white palaces,
lingering about the clear pools of green sea
water, where strange creatures swam lazily or
darted to and fro, looking their last at pictures
and stories in marble, and listening to the tinkle
of water plashing under great tropical leaves and
over strange mosses, strolling through temples
and past savage huts, and gazing in final questioning
at mysterious, barbarous faces; and at
last passing through the stately archway and
being borne away on the waters of the great
lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>As they had been carried away farther and
farther, and the white wonder had begun to lose
itself and fade into a white spirit of a strange and
lovely thing, Meg had felt the familiar throb at
her heart and the familiar lump in her throat.
And she had broken into a piteous little cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John Holt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is going, it is
going, and we shall never see it again! For it
will vanish away, it will vanish away!&rdquo; And the
tears rushed down her cheeks, and she hid her
face on his arm.</p>
<p>But though he had laughed his short laugh,
John Holt had made her lift up her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t vanish away. It&rsquo;s not
one of the things that vanish. Things don&rsquo;t vanish
away that a million or so of people have seen
as they&rsquo;ve seen this. They stay where they&rsquo;re
not forgotten, and time doesn&rsquo;t change them.
They&rsquo;re put where they can be passed on, and
passed on again. And thoughts that grow out of
them bring other ones. And what things may
grow out of it that never would have been, and
where the end is, the Lord only knows, for no human
being can tell. It won&rsquo;t vanish away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Dear little children and big ones, this is a Fairy
Story. And why not? There are not many
people who believe it, but fairy stories are happening
every day. There are beautiful things in
the world; there are many people with kind and
generous hearts; there are those who do their
work well, giving what is theirs to give, and being
glad in the giving; there are birds in the
skies, and flowers and leaves in the woods&mdash;and
Spring comes every year. These make the fairy
stories. Every fairy story has a moral, and this
one has two. They are these:</p>
<p>The human creature is a strong thing&mdash;when it
is a brave one.</p>
<p>Nature never made a human hand without putting
into it <i>something</i> to give.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
